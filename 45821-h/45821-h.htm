<p>These two names do not include two different
species, but only two distinct races, subsisting
from time immemorial in the camel
species. The principal, and perhaps the only
perceptible character by which they differ,
consists in the camel&rsquo;s bearing two hunches on
the back, and the dromedary only one, who is
also less, and not so strong as the camel; but
both of them herd and intermix together, and
the production from this cross breed is more
vigorous, and of greater value, than the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>These mongrels form a secondary race,
which mix and multiply among themselves,
and with the first race; so that in this species,
as well as in that of other domestic animals,
there are many varieties, the most general of
which are relative to the difference of climate.
Aristotle has judiciously marked the two principal
races; the first, which has two hunches,
under the name of the <i>Bactrian Camel</i>; and
the second under that of the <i>Arabian Camel</i>:
the first are called <i>Turkish</i> and the others <i>Arabian
Camels</i>. This distinction still subsists, but
it appears, since the discovery of those parts of
Africa and Asia which were unknown to the
ancients, that the dromedary is, without comparison,
more numerous and more universal
than the camel: the last being seldom found in
any other place than Turkestan, and some other
parts of the Levant; while the dromedary, more
common than any other beast of burthen in
Arabia, is found in all the northern parts of
Africa, from the Mediterranean to the river Niger,
and is also met with in Egypt, in Persia, in
Southern Tartary, and in all the northern parts of
India. The dromedary, therefore, occupies an
immense tract of land, while the camel is confined
to narrow limits. The first inhabits hot and
parched regions; the second, a more moist soil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and temperate climate; and the whole species,
as well the one as the other, appears to be confined
to a zone of three or four hundred leagues
in breadth, which spreads from Mauritania to
China, for they subsist neither above nor below
this zone, and although a native of warm
climates, this animal is averse to those where
the heat is excessive; his species ends where
that of the elephant begins, and it cannot exist
either under the burning heat of the torrid
zone, or in the milder climates of the temperate.
It appears to be originally a native of
Arabia, for that is not only the country where
they are the greatest in number, but where they
seem to be in the best condition. Arabia is the
most dry country in the world, and one in
which water is the most scarce. The camel is
the least thirsty of all animals, and can pass
several days without any drink. The land is
almost in every part dry and sandy. The
feet of the camel are formed to travel in sand;
and he cannot support himself on moist and
slippery ground. Herbage and pasture are
wanting in this country, as is also the ox, whose
place is supplied by the camel.</p>

<p>We cannot be deceived as to the native
country of these animals, when we consider
their nature and structure which must be conformable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thereto; especially when those are
not modified by the influence of other climates.
It has been tried, but without effect, to multiply
camels in Spain; they have also in vain
been transported to America, but they have
neither succeeded in the one climate, nor in the
other, and they are seldom to be met with in
the East Indies beyond Surat and Ormus: not
that we mean to say absolutely that they cannot
subsist and increase in the East Indies,
Spain, America, and even in colder countries,
as in France, Germany, &amp;c. By keeping
them during the winter in warm stables, feeding
and treating them with care, not letting
them labour, or suffering them to walk out
but when the weather is fine, they might be
kept alive and we might even hope to see them
multiply; but such productions are small and
imbecile, and the parents themselves are weak
and languid.   They lose, therefore, all their
value in these climates, and, instead of being
useful, they are very expensive to bring up,
while in their native country they may be said
to compose all the wealth of their masters.</p>

<p>The Arabs regard the camel as a present
from Heaven, a sacred animal, without whose
aid they could neither subsist, trade, nor travel.
The milk of these beasts is their common nourishment:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
they likewise eat their flesh, especially
that of the young ones, which they reckon
very good. The hair of these animals,
which is fine and soft, and is renewed every
year, serves them to make stuffs for their clothing
and their furniture. Blest with their camels,
they not only want for nothing, but they
even fear nothing. In a single day they can
traverse a tract of fifty leagues into the desert,
and thus escape from their enemies. All the
armies in the world would perish in pursuit of
a troop of Arabs; and hence they are no further
submissive than they please. Let any one
figure to himself a country without verdure
and without water; a burning sun, a sky always
clear, plains covered with sand, and
mountains still more parched, over which the
eye extends and the sight is lost, without being
stopped by a single living object; a dead
earth constantly whirled about by the winds,
presenting nothing but bones, flints scattered
here and there, rocks perpendicular, or overthrown;
a desert entirely naked, where the traveller
never drew his breath under a friendly
shade, where nothing accompanies him, and
where nothing reminds him of an animated
nature; an absolute solitude, a thousand times
more frightful than that of the deepest forests;
for trees appear as beings to the man, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
thus desolate, thus naked, and thus lost, in
an unbounded void, looks over all the extended
space as his tomb: the light of the day,
more dismal than the shade of the night, serves
but to renew the idea of his own wretchedness
and impotencies, and to present before his
eyes the horror of his situation, by extending
round him the immense abyss which separates
him from the habitable parts of the earth; an
immensity which he, in vain, attempts to overrun;
for hunger, thirst, and burning heat,
haunt every weary moment that remains between
despair and death.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Arab has found means, by
the aid of the camel, to surmount these difficulties,
and even to appropriate to himself
these frightful gaps of Nature: they serve him
for an asylum, they secure his repose, and
maintain his independence.&mdash;But why does
not man know how to make use of any thing
without abuse? This same free, independent,
tranquil, and even rich Arab, instead of respecting
these deserts as the ramparts of his
liberty, sullies them with his guilt; he traverses
them to rob the neighbouring nations of
their slaves and gold; he makes use of them
to exercise his robberies, which, unfortunately
he enjoys more than his liberty; for his enterprizes
are almost always successful. Notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the caution of his neighbours, and the
superiority of their forces, he escapes their
pursuit, and carries away with impunity all
that he has plundered them of.</p>

<p>An Arab, who destines himself to this business
of land piracy, early hardens himself to
the fatigue of travelling; he accustoms himself
to the want of sleep, to suffer hunger, thirst,
and heat. For the same purpose he instructs
his camels, he brings them up, and exercises
them in the same method. A few days after
their birth, he bends their legs under their bellies,
forces them to remain on the earth, and in
this situation loads them with a heavy weight,
and which he only relieves them from to put
on greater. Instead of suffering them to feed
at pleasure, and to drink when they are thirsty,
he regulates their repasts, and by degrees increases
them to greater distances between each
meal, diminishing also, at the same time, the
quantity of their food. When they are tolerably
strong, he exercises them in the course;
he excites their emulation by the example of
horses, and by degrees renders them as swift,
and more robust. At length, when he is assured
of the strength and swiftness of his
camels, and that they can endure hunger and
thirst, he then loads them with whatever is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
necessary for his and their subsistence, departs
with them, arrives unexpected at the borders
of the desert, stops the first passenger he sees,
pillages the straggling habitations, loads his
camels with his booty, and if he is pursued, if
he is obliged to expedite his retreat, it is then
that he displays all his own, and his animal&rsquo;s
talents. Mounted on one of his swiftest
camels, he conducts the troop, makes them
travel day and night, almost without stopping
either to eat or drink; and in this manner, he
easily passes over the space of three hundred
leagues in eight days; and during all that time
of fatigue and travel, he never unloads his
camels, and only allows them an hour of repose,
and a ball of paste each day. They
often run in this manner for nine or ten days
without meeting with any water, and when,
by chance, there is a pool at some distance,
they smell the water at more than half a league
before they come to it. Thirst makes them
redouble their pace, and then they drink
enough for all the time past, and for as long
to come; for they often travel many weeks,
and their abstinence endures as long as they
are upon their journey.</p>

<p>In Turkey, Persia, Egypt, Arabia, Barbary,
&amp;c. all their merchandize is carried by camels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which of all conveyances is the most ready and
cheapest. Merchants and other travellers
assemble themselves in caravans to avoid the
insults and robberies of the Arabs. These
caravans are often very numerous, and always
composed of more camels than men. Each
camel is loaded according to his strength,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and
of this they are themselves so conscious that
when overloaded they refuse to proceed, but
remain in their resting posture till their burthen
be lighted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The Orientalists call the camel the <i>ship of the desert</i>, alluding
to the heavy loads which it carries.</p></div>

<p>Large camels generally carry 1000, or even
1200lbs. weight, and the smaller 6 or 700.
In these commercial journeys, they do not
travel quick, and as the route is often seven or
eight hundred leagues, they regulate their motions
and journeys; they only walk, and go
every day ten or twelve leagues; they are unloaded
every evening, and are suffered to feed
at liberty. In a country where there is plenty
of pasture, they eat enough in one hour to
ruminate the whole night, and to serve them
twenty-four; but they seldom meet with such
pastures, and this delicate food is not necessary
for them. They even seem to prefer worm-wood,
thistles, nettles, furze, and other thorny
vegetables to the softest herbs; and as long as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
they can find plants to brouze on, they easily
dispense with drink.</p>

<p>But, this facility, with which they abstain
so long from drink, is not pure habit, but
rather an effect of their formation. Independently
of the four stomachs, which are
common to ruminating animals, the camel is
possessed of a fifth bag, which serves him as a
reservoir to retain the water. This fifth stomach
is peculiar to the camel; it is so large as
to contain a great quantity of water, where it
remains without corrupting, or the other aliments
being able to mix with it. When the
animal is pressed with thirst, or has occasion
to macerate his dry food for ruminating, he
causes a part of this water to re-ascend into the
paunch, and even into the &oelig;sophagus, by a
simple contraction of the muscles. It is, therefore,
by virtue of this very singular conformation,
that the camel can remain several days
without drink, and that he can take at one
time a prodigious quantity of water, which
continues pure and limpid in this reservoir,
because neither the liquors of the body, nor the
juices of digestion are able to mix with it.</p>

<p>If we compare the deformities, or rather the
non-conformities of the camel with other quadrupeds,
we cannot doubt but his nature has
been considerably altered by constraint, slavery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and continual labour. The camel is the most
completely, the most laboriously, and the most
anciently enslaved of all domestic animals;
the most anciently, because he inhabits climates
where man was the most early civilised;
the most completely, because in the other species
of domestic animals, such as the horse,
the dog, the ox, the sheep, the hog, &amp;c. we
find some individuals in their natural state,
which have not yet been subjected by man;
but the whole species of the camel is enslaved,
and not any of them are to be found in their
primitive state of independence and liberty;
and lastly, he is the most laborious slave, because
he has never been trained, either for shew,
as are many horses, or for amusement, as are
almost all dogs, or for the use of the table, as
are the ox, the hog, the sheep, &amp;c. He is the
only beast of burden whom man has not harnessed,
or taught to draw, but whose body is
looked upon as a living carriage, which may
be loaded and oppressed, even during his time
of rest; and when in haste sleeps under the
pressure of a heavy burden, his legs bent under
him, and the weight of his body resting upon
his stomach. This animal always bears the
marks of slavery and pain. Below the breast,
upon the sternum, there is a large callosity, as
tough as horn, and similar ones upon the joints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of his legs; although these callosities are to be
met with on every camel, yet they themselves
prove that they are not natural, but produced
by excessive constraint and pain, from being
often found filled with pus. The breast and
legs, therefore, are deformed by these callosities:
the back is also disfigured with a double
or single hunch, and both these hunches and
callosities are perpetuated from one generation
to another. As it is evident, that the first deformity
proceeds from the custom of forcing
them when quite young to lay on their stomachs,
with their legs bent under them, and
in that cramped posture, to bear not only the
weight of their bodies, but also the burthens
which are put upon them; it must be presumed,
that the hunch or hunches, owe their origin to
the unequal compression of heavy burthens,
which may have raised the flesh, and puffed up
the fat and skin; for these hunches are not bony,
but composed of a fleshy substance, partly
of the same consistence as the udder of a cow.
Thus the callosities and the hunches should be
equally regarded as deformities produced by
the continuance of labour, and constraint of
body; and though at first accidental and individual,
they are now become general and
permanent in the whole species. It may also
be presumed, that the bag which contains the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
water, and which is only an appendix to the
paunch, has been produced by a forced extension
of this viscera. The animal after enduring
thirst for a long time by taking at one time as
much, and, perhaps more water than the stomach
could contain, this membrane would become
extended and dilated, as has been observed
in the stomach of sheep, which extends
and acquires a capacity in proportion to the
quantity of its aliment. The stomach is very
small in sheep that are fed with grain, while it
becomes very large in those that are fed with
herbage.</p>

<p>These conjectures would be fully confirmed,
or destroyed, if any of these animals could be
found wild to compare with the domestic;
but these animals do not exist any where in a
natural state, or if they do, no one has yet remarked
or described them; we must, therefore,
suppose, that all which is good and fair about
them they owe to Nature, and that all that is
defective and deformed is occasioned by the
labour and slavery imposed on them by the
empire of man. These poor animals must
suffer a great deal, as they make lamentable
cries, especially when overloaded; but, notwithstanding
they are continually oppressed,
they have as much spirit as docility. At the
first sign they bend their legs, and kneel upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the ground, to be loaded, thus saving the
trouble of lifting up the burden to any great
height. As soon as they are loaded they raise
themselves up again without any assistance,
and the conductor, mounted on one of them,
precedes the whole troop who follow in the
same pace as he leads. They want neither
whip nor spur, but when they begin to be
fatigued their conductors support their spirit,
or rather charm their weariness, by a song, or
the sound of some instrument. When they
want to prolong the day&rsquo;s journey they give the
animals but one hour&rsquo;s rest, after which, renewing
their song, they proceed on their way
for several hours more, and the singing continues
until they come to another resting
place; then the camels again kneel down, and
are eased of their loads, by the cords being
untied, and the bales rolling down on each
side. In this cramped posture, with their bellies
couched upon the earth, they sleep in
the midst of their baggage, which is tied on
again the next morning with as much readiness
and facility as it was untied before they
went to rest.</p>

<p>The callosities and tumours on their breast
and legs, the bruises and wounds of the skin,
the entire shedding their hair, the hunger,
thirst, and leanness of these animals are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
their only inconveniences; they are prepared
for all these evils by one still greater, namely,
castration. They leave but one male for eight
or ten females, and all the camels of burden
are commonly geldings; they are weaker
without doubt than those which are not mutilated,
but they are more tractable, and ready
for employ at all times; while the others are
not only ungovernable but even furious, in
the rutting time, which remains forty days,
and returns every spring; when, it is affirmed,
they continually foam, and one or two red
vesicles, as large as a hog&rsquo;s bladder, issue from
their mouths. At this time they eat very
little, attack and bite animals, and even their
masters, to whom at other times they are very
submissive.</p>

<p>The camel does not copulate like other
quadrupeds, for the female sinks upon her knees
and receives the male in the same situation as
she rests, sleeps, or is loaded. This posture,
to which they are easily accustomed, becomes
natural to them, since they assume it at the
time of their copulation. The female goes
about twelve months with young, and, like all
large quadrupeds, produces but one at a birth:
they have great plenty of milk, which is thick
and nourishing, even for the human species,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
when mixed with a great quantity of water.
The females seldom do any labour when with
young, but are suffered to bring forth at liberty.
The advantages derived from their
produce, and their milk, perhaps surpasses that
which would be gained by their labour; nevertheless,
in some places a great part of the females
undergo castration, in order to render
them more fit for labour; and it is pretended,
that this operation, instead of diminishing augments
their strength and vigour, and adds to
the beauty of their appearance. In general
the fatter camels are, the more capable they are
of enduring great fatigue. Their hunches
appear to be formed from the superabundance
of nourishment, for in long journeys, where
they are stinted in their food, and where they
suffer both hunger and thirst, these hunches
gradually diminish, and are reduced so flat that
their places are only discovered by the length
of the hair, which is always longer on these
parts than on the rest of the back; the leanness
of the body increases in proportion as the
hunches diminish. The Moors, who transport
all their merchandize from Barbary and from
Numidia into Ethiopia, depart with their
camels well loaded, who are then very fat and
vigorous, but bring the same animals back so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lean that they commonly sell them at a low
price to the Arabs of the desart, who fatten
them anew</p>

<p>The ancients have affirmed that these animals
are capable of generating at the age of
three years: this appears to me rather doubtful,
for at that age they have not attained half their
growth. The genital member of the male,
like that of the bull, is very long and slender;
it tends forward during copulation, like that of
every other animal; but in its usual state, it is
bent backwards, and voids the urine between
the legs, so that the male and female pass their
urine in the same manner. The young camel
sucks its mother twelve months, and when designed
for labour, to make him strong and robust
they leave him at liberty to suck or graze
for a longer time, nor begin to load or put him
to work till he has attained the age of four
years. The camel commonly lives forty or fifty
years, which term of life is proportioned to
the time of its growth. It is without any
foundation that some authors have advanced
that he lives a hundred years.</p>

<p>By uniting under one point of view all the
qualities of this animal, and all the advantages
which are gained by him, he must be acknowledged
to be the most useful of all the
creatures under subordination to man. Gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and silk are not the true riches of the east, the
camel is the treasure of Asia. He is of
greater value than the elephant, as he does as
much labour, and consumes not a twentieth
part of the food. Besides the whole species
is subjected to man, who propagates and multiplies
it as much as he pleases. But it is not
so with the elephants, whom they cannot multiply,
can only subdue them individually, and
that with great trouble and difficulty. The
camel is not only of greater value than the
elephant but perhaps not of less than the horse,
the ass, and the ox, when all their advantages
are united. He carries as much as two mules,
and not only eats less, but feeds on herbs
as coarse as the ass. The female furnishes milk
longer than the cow; the flesh of young
camels is as good and wholesome as veal; their
hair is finer, and more sought after than the best
wool. Even their excrements are useful, for
sal ammoniac is made of their urine, and their
dung, when dried and powdered, serves them
for litter, as well as the horses, with whom
they often travel in countries where neither
straw nor hay is known. To conclude, they
also make excellent fewel of this dung, which
burns freely, gives a flame as clear, and almost
as lively, as that of dry wood, and which is of
great use in the deserts, where not a tree is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
be seen, and where, from the deficiency of
combustible matters, fire is almost as scarce as
water.</p>

<p>Although the Buffalo is now common
in Greece, and tame in Italy, it was known by
neither the ancient Greeks nor Romans; for he
never had a name in the language of these
people. The word <i>buffalo</i>, even indicates a
foreign origin, not derived either from the
Greek or Latin tongues. In effect, this animal
is originally a native of the warmest climates
of Africa and India, and was not transported
and naturalized in Italy, till towards the seventh
century. The moderns very improperly apply
the name of <i>bubalus</i> to this animal, which,
in Greek and Latin implies indeed, an African
animal, but very different from the buffalo, as
it is easy to demonstrate, by many passages of
ancient authors. If we would ascribe the bubalus
to any particular genus, it rather belongs to
that of the antelope, than to that of the ox or
the buffalo<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>. Belon having seen a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hunched ox at Cairo, which differed from the
buffalo and common ox, imagined it might be
the <i>bubalus</i> of the ancients; but if he had
carefully compared the characters of the <i>bubalus</i>
given by the ancients, with those of this
small ox, he would have discovered his error;
besides, we can speak of it with decision, for
we have seen this small hunched ox alive, and
having compared the description we have
given of it with that of Belon, we can have no
doubt of its being the same animal. It was
shewn at the fair at Paris in 1752, under the
name of the <i>zebu</i>; which we have adopted to
describe this animal by, for it is a particular
breed of the ox, and not a species of the buffalo
or bubalus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Upon the first publication of Buffon&rsquo;s History, M. Caesani
made some remarks upon the assertion that the buffalo
had no name in the Greek or Latin languages and with a
great display of erudition, in a letter to Buffon, endeavoured
to shew that there <i>were</i> words in both these languages
which nearly approached to that of buffalo; but M. Buffon
himself justly remarks that Caetane rather proves the possibility
of deriving the name of buffalo from some words in
the Greek and Latin languages than that this name was
really in use among them.</p></div>


<p>Aristotle, speaking of oxen, only mentions
the common ox, except saying, that among the
Arachotas in India, there are wild oxen, which
differ from the domestic ones as much as wild
boars differ from hogs; but in another part, he
gives the description of a wild ox of PÃ¦onia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a province adjoining to Macedonia, which he
calls <i>bonasus</i>. Thus the common ox and the
bonasus, are the only animals of this kind taken
notice of by Aristotle; and what must appear
singular, the bonasus, although fully described
by this great philosopher, has not been recognised
by any of the Greek or Latin naturalists
who have written after him, all of whom have
literally copied him on this subject; so that to
this day, there is no more than the name of
bonasus known, without the knowledge of the
animal which it ought to be applied to. If
we consider, that Aristotle, in speaking of the
wild oxen of temperate climates, has only
mentioned the bonasus; and that, on the contrary,
the Greek and Latin authors of succeeding
ages, have not spoken of the bonasus,
but describe these wild oxen by the names of
<i>urus</i> and <i>bison</i>, we shall be led to believe, that
the bonasus must be either the one or the other
of these animals; indeed by comparing what
Aristotle has said of the bonasus, with what
we know of the bison, it is more than probable,
that these two names indicate the same
animal. Julius CÃ¦sar is the first who mentions
the urus. Pliny and Pausanias are also
the first who speak of the bison. Since Pliny&rsquo;s
time, the name of <i>bubalus</i> has been given indiscriminately
to the urus, or the bison, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
this confusion has increased with time. To
the bonasus, bubalus, urus, and bison, have
been added, the <i>catopleba</i>, the <i>thur</i>, the <i>bubalus</i>
of Belon, the bisons of Scotland and America,
and all our naturalists have made as many
different species as they have found names.
The truth is here so obscured by clouds, and
so surrounded with errors, that it will be difficult
to clear up this part of Natural History,
which the contradiction of reports, the variety
of descriptions, the multiplicity of names, the
diversity of places, the difference of languages,
and the obscurity of the times, seems to
have condemned to perpetual darkness.</p>

<p>I shall, therefore, give my opinion upon
this subject, and afterwards present the proofs
upon which it is founded.</p>

<p>1. The animal at present called <i>buffalo</i>,
(<a href="#FIG_137"><i>fig. 137.</i></a>) was not known to the ancients.</p>

<p>2. The buffalo, at present domestic in Europe,
is the same as the tame or wild buffalo
of India and Africa.</p>

<p>3. The <i>bubalus</i> of the Greeks and Romans
is neither the buffalo nor the small ox of Belon,
but the animal that the gentlemen of the Academy
of Sciences have described in treating
of the <i>Barbary cow</i>, and which we call the
<i>bubalus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The small ox of Belon which we have
seen, and call by the name of <i>zebu</i>, is no more
than a variety in the species of the ox.</p>

<p>5. The <i>bonasus</i> of Aristotle is the same animal
as the bison (<a href="#FIG_138"><i>fig. 138.</i></a>) of the Latins.</p>

<p>6. The <i>bison</i> of America might originally
come from the bison of Europe.</p>

<p>7. The <i>urus</i> or <i>aurochs</i>, is the same animal
as our common bull, in his wild and natural
state.</p>

<p>8. The bison only differs from the aurochs
by accidental varieties, and consequently he is,
as well as the aurochs, of the same species as
the domestic ox; so that, it appears, all the
denominations, and all the pretended species
of the ancient and modern naturalists may be
reduced to three; namely, the ox, the buffalo,
and the bubalus.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that some of the propositions
which I have laid down will appear mere bold
assertions, particularly to those who are employed
with the nomenclature of animals, or have
endeavoured to give a catalogue of them; nevertheless,
there is not one of these assertions
which I am not able to prove. But before I
enter into critical discussions, each of which
demand particular propositions, I shall explain
the observations and facts which conducted
me into this enquiry, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
having satisfied me, may also prove satisfactory
to others.</p>

<p>Domestic animals in very few respects resemble
wild ones; their nature, their size, and
their form, are less constant, and more subject
to changes, especially in the exterior parts of
the body. The influence of climate, so powerful
over all Nature, acts with more force upon
captive animals, than upon free. Food prepared
by the hand of man, oftentimes scantily
given and ill-chosen, joined to the inclemency
of a foreign sky, in time produces alterations
sufficiently deep to become constant, and to be
perpetuated from one generation to another.
I do not pretend to say, that this general cause
of alteration is so powerful as to essentially
alter the nature of beings, whose constitution
is so fixed as that of animals; but it changes
them in certain respects; it disguises and transforms
them externally; it takes away from some
parts, and gives rise to others; it paints them
with various colours, and by its action upon
the habit of the body, it has an influence on
their dispositions, instincts, and most interior
qualities. A single part changed in a composition
so perfect as that of an animal body, is
sufficient to make the whole sensible of the
alteration; and it is for this reason, that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
domestic animals differ almost as much in dispositions
and instincts as in figure from those
who continue at large in their natural state.
Of this, the sheep furnishes a striking example;
this species, such as it is at present, perishes
in a very short time, if man ceases from
tending it with care: it is also greatly changed,
and very inferior to its original species.
But to adhere to our present subject; we see
what changes the ox has gone through, from
the combined effects of climate, nourishment,
and treatment, in a wild, and in a domestic
state.</p>

<p>The most general, and most remarkable variety
in domestic and even wild oxen, consists
in that sort of hunch which some have between
the shoulders: this race of oxen are
called <i>bisons</i>, and it has been hitherto believed,
that they were of a different species
from the common ox; but as we are assured,
that they produce together, and that the
hunch diminishes in the first generation, and
disappears in the second or third, it is evident,
that this hunch is only a variable and accidental
character, which does not prevent the
bison from belonging to the same species with
the common ox. There were formerly in the
desart parts of Europe, wild oxen, some without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hunches, and others with them; thus the
variety seems to be natural, and to proceed from
the abundance and more substantial quality of
food; for we remarked, when treating of the
camels, that when those animals are lean, and
badly fed, they have not even the appearance
of a hunch. The ox without a hunch was
named <i>vrochs</i>, and <i>turochs</i>, in the German
tongue; and the ox with a hunch, in the same
language, was termed <i>visen</i>. The Romans,
who knew neither of these wild oxen before
they saw them in Germany, adopted those
names; of <i>vrochs</i> they made <i>vrus</i>; and of
<i>visen</i>, <i>bison</i>; and they never imagined that the
wild ox described by Aristotle, under the name
of <i>bonasus</i>, could possibly be either of these
oxen, whose names they had thus latinised.</p>

<p>Another difference between the aurochs and
the bison is the length of the hair; the neck,
shoulders, and throat of the bison are covered
with very long hairs; while the aurochs have all
these parts covered with a short hair, resembling
that of the rest of the body, the front excepted,
which has frizzled hair. But this difference
of the hair is still more accidental than
that of the hunch, and, like that, depends on
the food and climate, as we have already proved
in the goats, sheep, dogs, cats, &amp;c. Thus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
neither the hunch, nor the difference in the
quantity of hair, are specific characters, but
merely simple and accidental variations.</p>

<p>A variety still more extended, and to which
naturalists have given more of character than
it really deserves, is the form of the horns;
they have not considered that, in our domestic
cattle, the shape, size, position, direction, and
even number of horns, vary so strongly, that
it would be impossible to pronounce which is
the true model of Nature. The horns of
some cows are curved and bent downwards;
others have them straight, long, and elevated.
There are whole races of sheep, who have
sometimes two, sometimes four horns, and there
are breeds of cows who have no horns. These
exterior, or, as I may say, accessory parts of
the body, have as little permanency as the colours
of the hair, which in domestic animals vary
and combine in every manner. This difference
in the shape and direction of the horns,
which is so common, must not then be regarded
as a distinctive character of the species;
though, it is upon this character alone that
our naturalists have established their species;
and, as Aristotle, in the description he gives of
the bonasus, says, that its horns turn inwards,
they have from that alone separated it from all
other oxen, and made it a particular species,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
without having ever seen the individual.
Upon this variation of the horns, in domestic
animals, we have quoted cows and ewes, rather
than bulls and rams, because the females
are more numerous than the males, and we
may every where observe thirty cows or ewes
for one bull or ram.</p>

<p>The mutilation of animals by castration
seems to hurt the individual only, and not to
affect the species; nevertheless, it is certain,
that this custom restrains Nature on one side
and weakens it on the other. A single male,
condemned to serve thirty or forty females,
must exhaust himself without satisfying them.
The ardour of love must be unequal; indifferent
in the male, who exceeds the designs
of Nature, and too ardent in the female, who
must be so limited; from thence all the
productions must chiefly be tinctured with
feminine qualities, a greater number of females
will be produced than males; and
even the males possess more of the mother
than the father. This is, without doubt,
the reason there are more girls than boys
born in the countries where men have a great
number of wives, while among those where
the men are permitted to have but one, more
males than females are born. It is true, that
among domestic animals they commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
withhold the most beautiful from castration,
to become the parent of a numerous generation.
The first productions of these chosen
males will be strong and vigorous; but from
having too many copies from this single
mould the impression of Nature is deformed,
or at least impaired, and not preserved in its
full perfection; the race must, therefore, be
weakened and degenerate; and this, perhaps,
is the cause why more monsters are to be
found among domestic than wild animals,
where the number of males, which concur to
generation, is equal to that of the females.
Moreover, when there is but one male to a
great number of females they have not the liberty
of consulting their own taste, and, consequently,
deprived of those emotions which
arise from spontaneous pleasures. In the females
there remains nothing poignant in their
amours, and they languish in expecting the
cold approaches of a male that is not of their
own choice, who is frequently not accommodated
to them, and from whom they do not
receive those flattering caresses as if he were
obliged to court a preference. From these
sluggish amours insipid beings must proceed,
who will have neither that courage, spirit, nor
strength, which Nature only can bestow on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
every species by leaving to individuals their
faculties quite entire, especially the liberty of
choice between the sexes. It is well known,
in the example of horses, that the cross breed
is always the finest; we ought not, therefore,
to confine our female cattle to a single male of
their own country, who already has too much
the resemblance of his mother, and who, consequently,
far from improving the species, can
only continue to degrade it. Mankind, in this
practice, have preferred their convenience to
every other advantage; they have not endeavoured
to support, or to embellish Nature,
but submit her operations to them, that they
may enjoy her productions in a more despotic
manner. The males are the superior of each
species; they have the most spirit, and are
the least tractable; a greater number of males
in our flocks therefore would render them less
docile, more difficult to conduct and to watch.</p>

<p>To these causes of degeneration in domestic
animals we must yet mention another, which
alone is capable of producing more changes
than all the rest put together, viz. the transportation
of animals from one climate to another;
oxen, sheep, and goats, have been carried
to all parts; in every place they have felt
the influence of the climate, and imbibed impressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from every soil and every sky, so that
nothing is more difficult than to recognize, in
this great number of varieties, those who are
the least estranged from the type of Nature.</p>

<p>Having thus explained the general causes of
varieties among domestic animals, I shall proceed
to the particular proofs of what I have
advanced on the subject of oxen and buffaloes.
I have said, 1st. <i>That the animal at present
known by the name of the buffalo was not known
by the ancient Greeks, and Romans.</i> This
is evident, since none of their authors have
described, or even used, a name which can be
applied to it; besides, we are informed, by
the annals of Italy, that the first buffalo was
brought there towards the end of the fifth century,
A. D. 595.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Buffalo, at present domestic in Europe,
is the same as the wild or tame buffalo of
India and Africa.</i> This needs no other proof,
than the comparison of our description of the
buffalo, taken from an animal we saw alive,
with the remarks that travellers have given of
the buffaloes of Persia, Mogul, Bengal, Egypt,
Guinea, and the Cape of Good Hope. In all
these countries this animal is the same, and
does not differ from our buffalo but in very
slight differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>The Bubalus of the Greeks and Romans,
is not the buffalo, nor the small ox of
Belon; but the animal that the gentlemen of
the Academy has described under the name
of the cow of Barbary.</i> This appears clear
from Aristotle placing the bubalus with the
stags and fallow deer, and not with the oxen.
In other parts, he speaks of him among the
roe-bucks, and says, that he but badly defends
himself with his horns, and that he flies from
ferocious animals. Pliny, in speaking of the
wild oxen of Germany, says, that it is through
ignorance that the common people give the
name of bubalus to these oxen, for the bubalus
is an animal of Africa, which in some
measure resembles a calf or a stag. The bubalus
is then a timid animal, who has no other
resource than by flight to avoid the attack of
ferocious animals, who consequently from this
circumstance must be swift, and possess something
of a make between the calf and a stag;
all these characters, not one of which apply
to the buffalo, are found perfectly united in
the figure of the animal which <i>Horatius Fontana</i>
sent to Aldrovandus, and of which the
gentlemen of the Academy have given a figure
and description under the name of the <i>cow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Barbary</i>; and they have thought, with me,
that it was the bubalus of the ancients.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The zebu, or small ox of Belon, has none of the characters
of the bubalus; it differs from it almost as much as
our ox differs from the antelope: Belon also is the only naturalist
who has considered this small ox to be the bubalus
of the ancients.</p></div>

<p>4. <i>The small ox of Belon is only a variety
in the species of the ox.</i> We shall easily prove
this, by only referring to the figure of the animal
given by Belon, Prosper Alpinus, Edwards,
and to the description we have made. We
have seen it alive; his conductor told us, that
he brought him from Africa, where he was
called <i>Zebu</i>; that he was domestic; and that
they used him to ride on. This animal is, in
fact, very gentle and familiar; he is of an
agreeable figure, though heavy and thick;
nevertheless he so perfectly resembles the ox,
that I cannot give a more just idea of him,
than by saying, if we were to look at a very
handsome bull, through a glass that diminishes
objects one half, the figure would very near
approach that of the zebu.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Bonasus of Aristotle is the same as
the bison of the Latins.</i> This proposition
cannot be proved, without a critical discussion,
with the whole detail of which I shall not
trouble the reader. Gesner, who was a learned
man, as well as a naturalist, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
thought with me, that the bonasus might be
the bison, has more carefully than any other
person examined and discussed the observations
which Aristotle gives on the bonasus, and at
the same time has corrected many erroneous
expressions in the translation of Theodore Gaza,
which nevertheless all the naturalists have
followed without examination: in adopting,
therefore, his elucidations, and in suppressing
from the remarks of Aristotle, whatever is obscure,
contradictory or fabulous, they appear
to me reduced to the following description:</p>

<p>The bonasus is a wild ox of P&oelig;onia, and is
at least as big as a domestic ox, and of the same
make; he is covered from the shoulders to the
eyes with a long hair, like the mane of a horse;
his voice is like the ox; his horns are short,
and curved round the ears; his legs are covered
with long hair, soft as wool, and his tail is
small compared to his size, although in other
respects it resembles that of the ox. Like the
bull, he has the custom of pawing the ground
with his feet; his hide is hard, his flesh is tender,
and good. By these characters, which are
all we can rely on from Aristotle, we see how
near the bonasus approaches towards the bison.
Every part, in fact, agrees, the shape of the
horns excepted, but which, as we have already
observed, greatly varies in animals, who are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
notwithstanding, of the same species. We
have seen such crooked horns, taken from an
hunched ox of Africa, and we shall hereafter
prove, that this hunched ox is no other than
the bison. This we shall be able to confirm
by the testimonies of ancient authors. Aristotle
mentions the bonasus as an ox of P&oelig;onia;
and Pausanias, speaking of the P&oelig;onian bulls,
says, in two different parts of his works, that
these bulls are bisons; he even expressly says,
that the bulls of P&oelig;onia, which he saw at the
public games at Rome, had very long hair
upon the breast, and about the jaws. In short,
Julius CÃ¦sar, Pliny, Pausanias, Solinus, &amp;c.
in speaking of wild oxen, mention the aurochs
and the bison, but take no notice of the bonasus.
It must, therefore, be supposed, that
in less than four or five centuries the species of
the bonasus has been lost, unless we allow that
the names <i>bonasus</i> and <i>bison</i> indicate only the
same animal.</p>

<p>6. <i>The bison of America might come originally
from the bison of Europe.</i> We have
already laid down the foundation of this opinion
in our discourse on the animals of the
two continents; they are the result of the experience
of M. de la Nux, who has given
much information on this subject. He has
informed us, that the bisons, or hunched oxen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of India and Africa, copulate with the bulls
and cows of Europe, and that the hunch is
only an accidental character, which diminishes
in the first generation, and disappears in the
second or third. Since the bisons of India are
of the same species as our oxen, and have,
consequently the same origin, is it not natural
to extend this organ to the bison of America?
Every thing seems to concur in support of
this supposition. The bisons appear to be originally
of cold and temperate regions; their
name is derived from the German language;
the ancients say that they were found in that
part of Germany which borders on Scythia;
and there are now bisons in the north of
Germany, in Poland, and in Scotland; they
might, therefore, have passed into America, or
even have come from thence, as they are animals
common to the two continents. The only
difference between the bisons of Europe and
those of America is, that the latter are less.
But even this difference is a new presumption
that they are of the same species, for we have
already remarked, that generally both domestic
and wild animals, which have passed of themselves,
or have been transported, into America,
have, without any exception, diminished in
size; besides, all the characters, even the
hunch, and the long hairs at the hinder parts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
are the same in the bisons of America and in
those of Europe; thus we cannot refuse to regard
them, not only as animals of the same
species but also of the same race.</p>

<p>7. <i>The urus, or aurochs, is the same animal
as the common bull, in his wild and natural
state.</i> This position is clear, as the figure
and constitution of the body of the aurochs is
perfectly similar to that of our domestic bull.
The aurochs is only larger and stronger, like
every other animal who enjoys his liberty.
The aurochs are still to be met with in some
provinces of the north. The young aurochs
have been taken from their mothers, and being
reared, when of a proper age have copulated
with the domestic bulls and cows, so that we
cannot doubt but they are of the same
species.</p>

<p>8. <i>To conclude, the bison differs from the
aurochs by accidental varieties only, and, consequently,
is also of the same species as the
domestic ox.</i> The hunch, the length and
quality of the hair, and the form of the horns,
are the sole characters by which we can distinguish
the bisons from the aurochs. But we
have known the hunched oxen produce with
the domestic kind; we likewise know, that the
length and quality of the hair, in all animals,
depend on the nature of the climate; and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
have remarked, that in oxen, goats, and sheep,
the form of the horns frequently varies. These
differences, therefore, are not sufficient to establish
two distinct species; and since our domestic
oxen produce with the hunched oxen
of India, we have reason to think they would
copulate with the bison, or hunched ox of Europe.
There are, in the almost innumerable
varieties of these animals, in different climates,
two primitive kinds, both of which have long
continued in a natural state; the hunched ox,
or bison, and the aurochs, or ox without an
hunch. These kinds have subsisted till this
present time, either in a wild or domestic state,
and are scattered, or rather have been transported,
into all the climates of the earth. All
the domestic oxen without hunches have proceeded
originally from the aurochs, and those
with the hunch from the bison. To give a
just idea of these varieties we shall make an
enumeration of them as they are found in the
different parts of the world.</p>

<p>To begin with the north of Europe; the
few oxen and cows of Iceland are deprived of
horns, although they are of the same kind as
our oxen. The size of these animals is rather
relative to the plenty and quality of pasture
than to the nature of the climate. The Dutch
fetch lean cows from Denmark, which fatten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
prodigiously in their rich meadows, and give
a great deal of milk: these Denmark cows are
larger than ours. The bulls and cows of the
Ukraine, where there is excellent pasture, are
said to be the biggest in Europe, and they are
of the same kind as our oxen. In Switzerland,
where the tops of the mountains are covered
with an abundant and flourishing verdure, and
which is solely reserved as food for the cattle,
the oxen are nearly double the size of those in
France, where commonly they are fed on the
coarsest herbage, which is refused by horses.
Bad hay, and leaves, are the common food of
our oxen in winter, and in spring, when they
should be refreshed, they are excluded from
the meadows; they, therefore, suffer still more
in that season than in winter, for they then have
little or nothing given them in the stable, but
are driven into the roads, into fallow fields, or
into the woods, and are always kept at a distance
from the fertile lands, so that they are
more fatigued than fed; at last, in summer,
they are permitted to enter the meadows, which
are then stripped, and parched with heat and
drought; there is not, therefore, a single season
throughout the year in which these animals
are amply or agreeably fed. This is the sole
cause which renders them weak, poor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
small; for, in Spain, and in some cantons of
the provinces of France, where there is good
pasture, and solely reserved for the oxen, they
are much stronger and larger.</p>

<p>In Barbary, and most part of Africa, where
the ground is dry, and the pasture poor, the
oxen are still smaller, the cows give much less
milk than those in France, and the greatest
part of them lose their milk when their calves
are taken from them. They are the same in
some parts of Persia, of Lower Ethiopia, and
in Great Tartary, while in the same countries,
and at very small distances, as in Calmuck
Tartary, in Upper Ethiopia, and in Abyssinia,
the oxen are a prodigious size. This difference,
therefore, depends more on the plenty
of their food than on the temperature of the
climate. In the northern, temperate, and
warm regions, we equally find, at very small
distances, small or large oxen, according to the
quantity and quality of the pasture, they are
fed upon.</p>

<p>The breed of aurochs, or ox without a
hunch, inhabits the cold and temperate zones,
and is not much dispersed in the southern
countries. On the contrary the breed of the
bison, or hunched ox, occupies all the southern
provinces. In the whole continent of India,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in the eastern and southern islands of all Africa,
from Mount Atlas to the Cape of Good Hope,
we find no others but hunched oxen; it even
appears, that this breed, which has prevailed
in all the warm countries, has many advantages
over the others; for, like the bison, of
which they are the issue, their hair is softer,
and more glossy than our oxen, who, like the
auroch, are furnished but with little hair, of a
harsh nature. These hunched oxen are also
swifter, and more proper to supply the place
of the horse<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>; at the same time they are less
clumsy, stupid, and indolent than our oxen.
They are more tractable, and sensible, have
more of that intelligence which renders them
useful; they are also treated with more care
than our finest horses. The regard the Indians
have for these animals is so great that
it has degenerated into superstition, the last
mark of blind respect. The ox, as the most
useful animal, has appeared to them the most
worthy of being revered; and they have made
an idol of the object of their veneration, a kind
of beneficent and powerful divinity; for we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are desirous of rendering all we respect, great,
and capable of doing much good, or much
harm.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> At Surat, Persia, and in all the provinces of India, they
are used for carrying burdens and drawing a kind of coaches,
and by constant habit they acquire such a dexterity that few
animals can outrun them. <i>See Voyages della Valle, Owington,
Mandelslo, Flacourt, Grosse, &amp;c.</i></p></div>

<p>These hunched oxen vary perhaps more
than ours in the colours of the hair, and the
figure of their horns, the handsomest are all
white, like the oxen of Lombardy. Some are
destitute of horns, while others have them very
much elevated, and others so bent down, that
they are almost pendent. It even appears,
that we must divide this first race of bisons, or
hunched oxen, into two secondary kinds; the
one large, and the other small, and this last is
that of the <i>zebu</i>. Both of them are found nearly
in the same climates, and are equally mild and
easily managed; both have soft hair, and a
hunch upon the back; this hunch is nothing
but an excrescence, a kind of wen, a piece of
tender flesh, as good to eat as the tongue of an
ox. The hunches of some oxen weigh from
forty to fifty pounds, others have them much
smaller. Some of these oxen have prodigious
large horns; there is one in the French king&rsquo;s
cabinet, which is three feet and a half in
length, and seven inches in diameter at the
base; many travellers affirm that they have
seen them, of a capacity sufficient to contain
fifteen, and even twenty pints of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The method of castrating large cattle is not
known in any part of Africa, and it is but
little practised in India. When the bulls undergo
this operation, it is not by cutting, but
compressing their testicles; and although the
Indians keep a number of these animals to draw
their carriages, and work in their grounds,
they do not by any means train up so many as
we do. As in all hot countries the cows give
but little milk; as the natives are but little acquainted
with cheese and butter; and as the
flesh of the calves is not so good as in Europe,
they multiply the horned beasts less than we do.
Besides, all those southern provinces of Africa
and Asia, being much less peopled than Europe,
there are a great number of wild oxen,
who are taken when young; these become
tame of themselves, and submit to labour without
any resistance; they become so tractable,
that they are managed with greater ease than
horses, the voice of their master is only requisite
to direct and make them obey; they are
very careful of them in every respect, and give
them plenty of the best food. These animals,
thus raised, appear to be of a different nature
from our oxen, who only know us by our bad
treatment; the goad, whip, and scarcity of
food, render them stupid and weak: in short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
if we knew our own interest, we should treat
what is dependent on us with better usage.
Men of inferior rank, and people the least
polished, seem to have a better sense than
others of the laws of equality, and the shades
of natural equality. The servant of the farmer
may be said to be upon a level with his master;
the horses of the Arabs, and the oxen of the
Hottentots, are favourite domestics, companions
in their exercises, assistants in their labour,
and with whom they share their habitation,
their bed, and their tables. Man, by this community,
debases himself less than the beasts
are elevated and humanized. They become
affectionate, sensible, and intelligent; they
there perform, through love, all that they do
here through fear. They do more; for as their
nature is raised by the gentleness of their education,
and by the continuance of attention
towards them, they become capable of actions
almost human. The Hottentots bring up their
oxen to war, and make use of them nearly in
the same manner as the Indians do of the elephants;
they instruct these oxen to guard their
sheep, to conduct them from place to place, and
to defend them from strangers and ferocious
beasts; they teach them to know friends from
enemies, to understand signs, and to obey the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
voice. Thus the most stupid of men are the
best preceptors of beasts.</p>

<p>All the southern parts of Africa and Asia are
then inhabited with bisons, or hunched oxen,
among which is a great variety in respect to
size, colour, shape of the horns, &amp;c. On the
contrary, all the northern countries of these two
parts of the world, and the whole of Europe,
comprehending the adjacent island, as far as
the Azores, have only oxen without hunches,
who derive their origin from the aurochs; and
as the aurochs, which is our ox in a wild state,
is larger and stronger than our domestic ones,
so the bison, or wild hunched ox, is also
stronger and larger than the tame ox of India.
He is also sometimes smaller, but that depends
only on the quantity of food. At Malabar, in
Abyssinia, and Madagascar, where the meadows
are naturally spacious and fertile, the
bisons are of a prodigious size; in Africa and
Arabia Petrea, where the land is dry, the
zebus, or bisons, are of a small size.</p>

<p>In every part of America oxen without
hunches are generally diffused, which the
Spaniards and other Europeans have successively
transported thither; these oxen have
considerably multiplied, but are become less
in these new countries. The species was absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
unknown in South America; but in all
the northern parts, as far as Florida, Louisiana,
and even nearly to Mexico, the bisons, or
hunched oxen, were found in great numbers.
These bisons, which formerly inhabited the
woods of Germany, Scotland, and other northern
countries, have probably passed from
one continent to the other, and are become,
like other animals, smaller in this new world;
and as they lived in climates more or less cold,
their hair became longer or shorter. Their
beards and hair is longer at Hudson&rsquo;s Bay than
at Mexico, and in general their hair is softer
than the finest wool. We cannot, therefore,
avoid believing these bisons of the new continent
are of the same species as those of the
old; they have preserved all the principal characters,
as the hunch upon the shoulders, the
long hair under the muzzle, and on the hinder
parts of the body, and the short legs and tail;
and by comparing what Hernandes, Fernandes,
and every other historian and traveller of the
new world have said, with what has been
written concerning the bison of Europe, we
shall be convinced, that these animals are not
of a different species.</p>

<p>Thus the wild and domestic ox, the ox of
Europe, Asia, America, and Africa; the bonasus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the aurochs, the bison, and the zebu, are
all animals of the same species, which according
to the differences of climate, food, and
treatment, have undergone all the variations
we have explained. The ox is the most useful
animal, and also the most universally dispersed;
for, excepting South America, he has been
found in all parts; his constitution being equally
formed to withstand the ardour of the south,
or rigours of the north. He appears to be ancient
in every climate; he is domestic in civilized
nations, and wild in desart countries or
among unpolished people. He supports himself
by his own resources when in a state of
nature, and never loses the qualities relative
to the service of man. The young wild calves,
which are taken from their mothers in India
or Africa, become in a very short time, as
tractable as those of the domestic kind; and
this natural conformity is another striking
proof of the identity of the species. The gentleness
of character in these animals indicates
the natural flexibility of their bodies; for in all
species in which we have discovered the character
of gentleness, and which have been subjected
to a domestic state, there are more varieties
than can be found in those which have remained
wild through their character of inflexibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>If it be asked, whether the aurochs or the
bison be the primitive race of oxen, a satisfactory
answer may be drawn from the facts we
have just laid down. The hunch of the bison
is, as it has been observed, no more than an accidental
character, which is defaced and lost in
the mixture of the two kinds. The aurochs, or
ox without a hunch, is, then, the most powerful
and predominant kind; if it were otherwise,
the hunch, instead of disappearing,
would extend and remain upon every one of
this mixt breed. Besides, this hunch of the
bison, like that of the camel, is less the production
of Nature than the effect of labour,
and the mark of slavery. From time immemorial,
in almost every quarter of the globe,
the ox has been obliged to carry burdens;
the habitual, and often excessive load, has
deformed their backs; and this deformity has
been afterwards propagated through generations.
Undeformed oxen are no longer to
be seen, but in those countries where they
have not made use of them as beasts of burden.
In all Africa, and in the eastern continent, the
oxen are hunched, occasioned by their having
always carried loads on their shoulders. In
Europe, where they are only employed for
draught, they have not undergone this deformed
alteration, which in the first place probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
proceeds from the compression of the loads,
and in the second from the abundance of food;
for it disappears when the animal is lean and
poorly fed. Some enslaved and hunched oxen
might have escaped or been abandoned in the
woods, and where their posterity would be
loaded with the same deformity, which, far
from disappearing, may have encreased by the
abundance of food peculiar to uncultivated
countries, so that this second breed would
spread over all the desart lands of the north
and south, and pass into the New Continent,
like other animals, whose nature can support
the cold. What still more confirms the identity
of the species of the bison and aurochs, is,
the bisons of North America have so strong a
smell, that they have been called <i>Musk Oxen</i>
by most travellers; and, at the same time, we
find, by the accounts of many persons, that
the aurochs, or wild ox of Prussia and Livonia,
has the same scent of musk.</p>

<p>There remains, therefore, but two species,
the buffalo and the ox, out of all the names
placed at the head of this article, each of which
the ancient and modern naturalists have treated
as separate and distinct. These two animals,
although greatly resembling each other, both
domestic, often living under the same roof, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
fed in the same meadows, have nevertheless
constantly refused to unite though excited to
it by their keepers. Their natures are more
distant than that of the ass and the horse;
there even appears to be a strong antipathy
between them, for it is affirmed, that cows
will not suckle young buffaloes, and the female
buffaloes refuse the same kindness to the
other calves. The buffalo is of a more obstinate
nature, and less tractable than the ox.
He obeys with great reluctance, and his temper
is more coarse and brutal. Next to the
hog, he is the filthiest of all domestic animals,
and is very unwilling to be cleaned and dressed.
His figure is very clumsy, and forbidding; his
look stupidly wild; he stretches out his neck in
an ignoble manner, and carries his head in a
very bad posture, almost always inclined towards
the ground. He bellows hideously, with
a tone much stronger and deeper than that of
the bull. His legs are thin, his tail bare, his
physiognomy dark, and his skin as black as his
hair. He differs chiefly from the ox by the
colour of his hide, which is easily perceived
under his spare covering of hair. His body
is thicker and shorter than that of the ox;
his legs are longer; his head proportionally
much less; his horns are not so round, black,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and partly compressed, and he has a tuft of
frizzled hair over his forehead. His hide is
likewise thicker and harder than that of the
ox. His flesh is black, and hard, and not only
disagreeable to the taste, but repugnant to the
smell. The milk of the female is not so good
as that of the cow, but she yields a greater
quantity. In hot countries, almost all the
cheese is made of buffalo&rsquo;s milk. The flesh
of the young buffaloes, though killed during
the sucking time, is not a bit better. The hide
alone is of more value than all the rest of the
animal, whose tongue is the only part that is
fit to eat: this hide is firm, pretty light, and
almost impenetrable. As these animals are
larger and stronger than oxen they are very
serviceable; they make them draw, and not
carry burdens; they lead them by the means
of a ring passed through their nose. Two buffaloes
harnessed, or rather chained, to a carriage,
will draw as much as four strong horses.
As they carry their necks and heads low, they
employ the whole weight of their body in
drawing, and their mass greatly surpasses that
of a labouring horse, or ox.</p>

<p>The height and thickness of the buffalo alone
indicates, that he is a native of warm countries.
The largest quadrupeds belong to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
torrid zone of the Old Continent; and the
buffalo, for his magnitude, ought to be placed
next to the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the
hippopotamus. The camel is taller but less
thick, and also a native of the southern countries
of Africa and Asia. Nevertheless, buffaloes
live and multiply in Italy, in France,
and in other temperate provinces. Those kept
in the royal menagerie, have brought forth
two or three times; the female has but one at
a birth, and goes with young about twelve
months, which is another proof of the difference
between this species and that of the cow,
who only goes nine months. It appears also,
that these animals are more gentle and less
brutal in their native country, and the warmer
the climate the more tractable is their nature.
In Egypt they are more tractable than in Italy;
and in India more so than in Egypt. Those of
Italy have also more hair than those of Egypt,
and those of Egypt more than those of India.
Their coat is never entirely covered, because
they are natives of hot countries; and in general,
large animals of these climates have
little or no hair.</p>

<p>There are a great number of wild buffaloes
in the countries of Africa and India, which
are watered by large rivers, and where extensive
pasturages are found. The wild buffaloes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
go in droves and make great havock in cultivated
lands, but they never attack the human
species, unless they are wounded, and are then
very dangerous; for they make directly at
their enemy, throw him down, and trample
him under their feet. They are, however,
greatly terrified at the sight of fire, and are
displeased at a red colour. Aldrovandus,
Kolbe, and many other naturalists and travellers,
assure us, that no person dare wear red
cloaths in the country where the buffaloes are.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
I know not whether this aversion to fire and a
red colour be general among the buffaloes: for
there are but few among our oxen who grow
angry at the sight of red cloaths.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Sonnini says, that he did not perceive the buffaloes of
Egypt to be affected in this manner by a red colour, for all
the inhabitants of this country wear round their neck and
breast a <i>chall</i> of the same colour, without the buffaloes appearing
to be affected or irritated.</p></div>

<p>The buffalo, like all large animals of warm
climates, is fond of bathing, and even of remaining
in the water; he swims well, and
boldly traverses the most rapid floods. As his
legs are longer than those of the ox, he runs
also quicker. The Negroes of Guinea, and
the Indians of Malabar, where the buffaloes
are very numerous, often hunt them. They
neither pursue nor attack them openly, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
climbing up the trees, or hiding themselves in
the thickets, which the buffaloes cannot penetrate,
on account of their horns, they wait for
and kill them. Those people are fond of the
flesh of the buffalo, and gain great profit by
vending their hides and horns, which are harder
and better than those of the ox.</p>

<p>The animal, called, at Congo, <i>Empacassa</i>
or <i>Pacassa</i>, though very badly described by
travellers, seems to me to be the buffalo; and
that which they have spoken of, under the name
of <i>Empabunga</i>, or <i>Impalunca</i>, in the same
country, may possibly be the bubalus, whose
history we shall give with that of the antelope.</p>

<p>M. De Querhoent says, that altho&rsquo;
the bisons invariably differ from the common
oxen by the hunch on their backs, and their
hair being longer, yet they breed in the Isle of
France, and their flesh is preferable to that of
European oxen; their hair is also smoother,
their legs thinner, and their horns are longer,
and after some few generations the hunch entirely
disappears. There was one brought to
Holland from North America, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
carried about to different towns, by a Swede, in
a large cage; this one had an enormous mane
round his head, which was not hair, but a very
fine wool, divided into locks like a fleece; the
skin was of a black colour, excepting on the
hunch, where the hair was longer, and under
that the skin was rather tawny; and to us this
animal seemed to differ from the European by
the hunch and wool only.</p>

<p>Bisons are said to have existed formerly in
the north of Europe, and Gesner asserts, that
even in his time there were some in Scotland;
but I have been credibly informed by letters,
both from England and Scotland, that not the
smallest remembrance of them can be traced
in that country. Mr. Bell, in his travels from
Russia to China, mentions seeing two species
of oxen in the northern parts of Asia, one of
which was the aurochs, and the other what we,
after Gmelin, have called the Tartarian, or
Grunting Cow, which seemed to be of the
same species as the bison; and in which we
find, by comparison, a perfect coincidence of
characters, excepting that the former grunts
and the latter bellows.</p>

<p>Although the race of the bisons appear diffused
in the Old Continent, from Madagascar
and the point of Africa, and from the extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the East Indies even to Siberia, and that
though they are met with in the new continent,
from the country of the Ilionois to Louisiana
and Mexico, they have never passed the isthmus
of Panama, for there are not any bisons in
South America, notwithstanding the climate
is perfectly agreeable to their nature, and European
oxen multiply there as well as in any
other place.</p>

<p>The best bulls and cows at Madagascar were
brought from Africa, and have a hunch on
their backs; but the cows give very little
milk. In this island there are wild bisons in
the forests, the flesh of which is not so good as
that of our oxen. The natives of Agra hunt
them on the mountain of Nerwer, in the road
from Surat to Golconda, and which is surrounded
with wood.</p>

<p>The zebu, as we formerly observed, is the
bison as well as the ox in miniature, and
though originally a native of warm regions,
can nevertheless exist and multiply in temperate
ones, for in a letter I received from Mr.
Colinson, dated London, December, 1764, he
assures me, that the Dukes of Richmond and
Portland had several of these animals in their
parks, and which brought forth calves every
year: they were originally brought from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
East Indies. He adds, that the females were
much larger than the males, but that the hunch
on the back was twice as big on the latter
as the former; that the young zebu sucks the
mother like other calves, but that in our climate
the milk soon dries up, and that it is necessary
to have another female to bring them
up; that the Duke of Richmond ordered one
of them to be killed, when its flesh was found
not to be near so good as that of the common
ox.</p>

<p>There may also be small oxen without the
hunch, which, like the zebu, constitute a particular
race; for Careri, in his journey from
Ispahan to Schiras, saw two small cows, which
had been sent as a present to the king, that did
not exceed the size of calves; they were fed
entirely upon straw, and yet were very fat.</p>

<p>As to the buffaloes, although they can make
but little use of their horns, they are compelled
to fight lions and tigers in the Mogul&rsquo;s
country. These animals are numerous in
warm and marshy countries, especially near
rivers, for water and a moist soil seems to be
more necessary to them than a warm climate;
there are not any of them therefore in Arabia,
where the country is dry. They hunt the
wild buffaloes, but with great caution, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are very dangerous, and when wounded rush
at their opponents with great fury.</p>

<p>M. de QuerhoÃ«nt says, the body of the buffalo,
at the Cape of Good Hope, is about the
size of our oxen, but his head is larger, and his
legs shorter. They generally keep about the
edge of the woods; and as he has a bad sight
he keeps his head near the ground, and when
he observe any disagreeable object near him
he makes a sudden dart upon it, making at the
same time a most hideous bellowing, and on
those occasions it is difficult to escape him;
but he is not so much to be feared in the open
fields: his hair is commonly red, with a few
black spots, and they are often seen together in
large flocks.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of this little ox
under the article buffalo; but as there has been
one brought to the royal menagerie since the
impression of that article, we can now speak
of it with greater exactness, and give an engraving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of it done from life. I have also
learned, by making new researches, that this
small ox, to which I have given the name of
<i>zebu</i>, (<a href="#FIG_145"><i>fig. 145.</i></a>) is very probably the same
animal which is called <i>lant</i>, or <i>dant</i>, in Numidia,
and in some other northern provinces of
Africa, where it is very common, and that the
name <i>dant</i>, which can belong to no other animal
but this we are treating of, has been transported
from Africa into America, and given
to an animal which only resembles this by
the size of his body, and who belongs to a
different species. This dant of America is the
tapir, or the maipouri; and in order that it may
not be confounded with the dant of Africa,
which is our zebu, we shall give the history
of it in this volume.</p>

<p>The weakest species of useful animals were
rendered domestic the earliest of any. The
sheep and goat were subjugated before the
horse, the ox, or the camel. They were also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
transported from one climate to another with
greater ease; hence the great variety which are
to be met with in these species, and the difficulty
of recognizing the original breed of each.
It is certain, as we have proved, that our domestic
sheep, as they at present exist, could
not support themselves without the assistance
of man; it is, therefore, evident that Nature
did not produce them as they at present are,
but that they have degenerated under our care;
consequently we must search among the wild
animals for those which come the nearest to
the sheep; we must compare them with the domestic
sheep of foreign countries, examine the
different causes of the alteration, change, and
degeneration, which has had such influence
upon the species, and endeavour to restore all
these various and pretended species to a primitive
race, as we have done in that of the ox.</p>

<p>The sheep, with which we are acquainted,
is only to be met with in Europe, and some
of the temperate provinces of Asia; if transported
into Guinea, it loses its wool, and is
covered with hair, it decreases in fertility, and
its flesh has no longer the same taste. It cannot
subsist in very cold countries, though a
breed of sheep is to be found in cold climates;
especially in Iceland, who have many horns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
short tails, and harsh thick wool, under which,
as in almost every animal in the north is a
second lining, of a softer, finer, and thicker
wool. In warm countries, on the contrary,
the sheep have generally short horns and a long
tail, some of which are covered with wool,
others with hair, and a third kind with a mixture
of wool and hair. The first of these sheep
of a warm country is that commonly called <i>Barbary
sheep</i>, or the <i>Arabian sheep</i>, which resembles
the domestic kind, excepting the tail which
is so loaded with fat, as to be often more than
a foot broad, and weighs upwards of twenty
pounds. This sheep has nothing remarkable
but his tail which he carries as if a pillow was
fastened to his hinder parts. Among this kind
of sheep, there are some whose tails are so long
and heavy, that the shepherds are obliged to
fasten small boards with wheels to them, to
enable the animal to walk along. In the
Levant, these sheep are cloathed with a very
fine wool, while in warm countries, as Madagascar,
and the Indies, they are covered with
hair. The superabundance of fat, which in
our sheep fixes about the kidneys, in these animals
descends upon the vertebrÃ¦ of the tail;
the other parts of their body are less charged
with it than our fed sheep. This variety is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be attributed to the climate, the food, and the
care of men; for these broad, or long-tailed
sheep, are domestic like ours, and even demand
more care and management. This breed is
much more dispersed than the common kind.
They are common in Tartary, Persia, Syria,
Egypt, Barbary, Ethiopia, Madagascar, and
even as far as the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>In the islands of the Archipelago, and chiefly
in the island of Candia, there is a breed of domestic
sheep, of which Belon has given the
figure and description under the name of <i>strepsiceros</i>:
this sheep is of the make and size
of our common kind; it is like that covered
with wool, and only differs from it by the
horns, which are erect, and in form of a
screw.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Sonnini observes that this race is also very common in
Hungary and Austria where it is called <i>zackl</i>.</p></div>

<p>In short, in the warmest countries of Africa
and India, there is a breed of large sheep with
rough hair, short horns, hanging ears, and a
kind of dewlap under the neck. This sheep,
Leo Africanus, and Marmol call <i>adimain</i>, and
it is known to the naturalists by the names
of the <i>Senegal ram</i>, the <i>Guinea ram</i>, the <i>Angola
sheep, &amp;c.</i> He is domestic, like ours, and
like him, subject to varieties. The sheep,
though they differ in particular characters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
resemble each other so much in other respects
that we cannot doubt they are of the same
kind. Of all domestic sheep, this appears to
approach nearest to a state of nature; he is
larger, stronger, quicker, and consequently
more capable of supporting himself; but as he
is only found in the hottest countries, and cannot
bear cold, and as he does not exist in his
own climate in a wild state, but is domestic
and obliged to the care of man for his support
we cannot regard him as the primitive
breed, from which all the rest have derived
their origin.</p>

<p>In considering domestic sheep, therefore, according
to the difference of climate, we find,
1. The sheep of the north, who have many
horns, and whose wool is coarse. The sheep
of Iceland, Gothland, Muscovy, and other
parts of the north of Europe, have all coarse
hair, and appear to be of the same breed.</p>

<p>2. Our sheep whose wool is very good
and fine in the mild climates of Spain and
Persia, but in hot countries changes to a rough
hair. We have already observed the conformity
in the influence of the climates of
Spain and Chorazan, a province of Persia,
upon the hair of goats, cats, and rabbits; it acts
in the same manner upon the wool of sheep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which is very fine in Spain, and still finer in
that of Persia.</p>

<p>3. The broad-tailed sheep, whose wool is
also very fine in temperate countries, such as
Persia, Syria, and Egypt; but which in warm
countries, changes into hair more or less
coarse.</p>

<p>4. The <i>strepsiceros</i>, or Canadian sheep, who
resembles ours both in wool and make, excepting
the horns, which are erect, and in the form
of a screw.</p>

<p>5. The <i>adimain</i>, or great sheep of Senegal
and India, which are covered with hair more
or less short or coarse according to the heat
of the climate. All these sheep are only varieties
of the same species, and certainly
would produce with each other, since we know
from experience that the he goat, whose species
is further distant, copulates with our ewes. But
though these five or six races of domestic sheep
are all varieties of the same species, entirely
produced by the difference of climate, treatment,
and food, yet none of them appear to
be the primitive stock from whence the others
sprung; nor is there any of them strong or
swift enough either to resist, or avoid, carnivorous
animals, by flight. They all equally
need care and protection, and must all, therefore,
be looked upon as degenerate races,
formed by the hands of man, and multiplied
for his use. At the same that he fed, cultivated,
and increased these domestic races, he
neglected, hunted, and destroyed the wild
breed, which being stronger and less tractable,
would, consequently, be more troublesome, and
less useful; they are, therefore, only to be met
with in small numbers, and in thinly inhabited
places, where they can support themselves.
In the mountains of Greece, in the islands of
Cyprus, Sardinia, and Corsica, and in the
desarts of Tartary, the animal, which we call
the <i>muflon</i> (<a href="#FIG_139"><i>fig. 139.</i></a>), is still to be found, and
which in my opinion is the primitive stock of
all the varieties of sheep; he lives in a state of
nature, and subsists and multiplies without the
help of man; he resembles the several kinds of
domestic sheep more than any other wild animal;
he is more lively, stronger, and swifter,
than any of them; his head, forehead, eyes,
and face, are like the ram&rsquo;s; he resembles him
also in the form of the horns, and in the whole
habit of the body; in short, he produces with
the domestic sheep, which alone is sufficient to
demonstrate that he is of the same species, and
the primitive stock of the different breeds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The only difference betwixt the muflon and
our sheep is, that the first is covered with hair
instead of wool; but we have already observed,
that even in domestic sheep the wool is not
an essential character, but a production of temperate
climates, since in hot countries these
same sheep have no wool, and are all covered
with hair; and that, in cold countries, their
wool is as coarse as hair. Hence it is not
astonishing that the primitive wild sheep, who
must have endured cold and heat, have lived
and increased without shelter in the woods and
deserts should not be covered with wool, which
he would soon be deprived of among the
thickets; and its nature would, in a short time,
be changed by the action of the air, and in
temperature of the seasons. Besides, when a
he-goat copulates with a domestic ewe, the
produce is a kind of muflon, for the lamb is
covered with hair, and is not a barren mule,
but a mongrel, which returns towards the
original species, and which appears to indicate,
that the goats and domestic sheep have something
in common with their origin; and, as we
know by experience, that the he-goat very
readily copulates with the ewe, but that the
ram is incapable of impregnating the she-goat,
it is not to be doubted, that, when these animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
are in a domestic state, the goat is the
predominant species. Thus our sheep is a
species much more degenerated than that of
the goat, and there is every reason to believe
that if the muflon were brought to the she-goat,
instead of a domestic ram, she would produce
kids approaching nearer to the species of the
goat, as the lambs produced between the he-goat
and ewe return nearer to the species of the
ram.</p>

<p>I know that naturalists, who have founded
their knowledge of Natural History on the
distinction of some particular characters, may
make some objections to this doctrine, and,
therefore, I shall endeavour to anticipate them.
The first character of the sheep, they will say,
is to be clothed with wool, and that of the
goat with hair. The second character of the
ram is to have circular horns, which turn
backwards, and that of the he-goat is to have
them straight and erect. These, they will
affirm, are the distinctive and infallible marks
by which sheep and goats will always be distinguished;
for as to the rest, they cannot avoid
acknowledging, they belong to them both in
common. Neither have incisive teeth in the
upper jaw, but each of them have eight in the
lower; both want the canine teeth, and both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
have cloven feet, simple and permanent horns,
teats in the same parts of the belly, both live
upon herbage, and ruminate. The internal
organization has still a greater resemblance, for
it appears to be absolutely the same; the number
and form of their stomachs, the disposition
of the viscera and intestines, the substance of
their flesh, the qualities of the fat and seminal
liquor, the time they go with young, and the
length of their lives, are perfectly the same.
There only remains, then, the wool and the
horns, by which these two species can be distinguished;
but we have already demonstrated
by facts, that wool is not so much a substance
of nature as a production of climate, assisted
by the care of man. The sheep of hot and
cold countries, and those which are wild, have
no wool, but hair, while the goats in very
mild countries have rather wool than hair, for
that of the Angola goat is finer than the
wool of our sheep. This character, therefore,
is not essential, but purely accidental, and even
equivocal, since it equally belongs to, or is
deficient, in both species, according to the difference
of climate. The character of the
horns appears to be still more uncertain; they
vary in number, size, form, and direction. In
our domestic sheep the rams have commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
horns, and the ewes have none; nevertheless,
I have seen in our flocks rams without horns
and ewes with them; and sheep not only with
two but four horns.   The sheep of the North,
and of Iceland, (<a href="#FIG_140"><i>fig. 140.</i></a>) have sometimes even
eight.   In hot countries the rams have only
two very short horns, and often are deficient of
them as well as the ewes.   In some the horns
are smooth and round, in others they are
furrowed and flat, and the points instead of
turning back, are often bent and come forward,
&amp;c.   This character, therefore, is not more
constant than the first, and consequently, not
sufficient to constitute a different species; the
largeness of the tail has also been considered,
by some naturalists, as an essential distinction,
and from the difference in the size of that, the
wool, and the horns, they have made seven or
eight different species of these animals, which
we have reduced to one; and this reduction appears
to be so well founded, that we are not
afraid of its being contradicted by future observation.</p>

<p>It appeared necessary in composing the History
of Wild Animals, to consider them one
by one, and independently of genus; but on
the contrary, in domestic animals, it appears
requisite even to extend the genera; because,
in Nature, there only exists individuals, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
succession of individuals, that is, species. Men
have had no influence on independent animals,
but they have greatly altered, modified, and
changed domestic ones; therefore, we have
made physical and real generas, greatly different
from metaphysical and arbitrary ones,
which have never existed but in idea. These
physical genera, are in reality composed of all
the species, which by our management have
been modified and changed, and as all these
species so differently altered by the hand of
man, have but one common and simple origin
in nature, the whole genus ought to form but
one species. For example, in writing the history
of tigers, we have admitted as many
species as are found in all the different parts
of the world, because, we are certain that man
has never subjected, nor changed the species
of those untractable animals, which subsist at
present such as Nature produced them. It is
the same with all other free and independent
animals. But in composing the history of oxen
and sheep, we have reduced all the first under
the species of a single ox; and the latter under
that of a single sheep, because, it is also certain,
that man, and not Nature, has produced
the different kinds which we have enumerated.
Every thing concurs to support this
idea, which, although clear in itself, may not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
perhaps, be sufficiently understood. That all
the different oxen produce together, we have
demonstrated by the experience of M. de la
Nux, and the testimonies of Messrs. Mentzelius
and Kalm; that the sheep also produce with
one another, with the muflon, and even with
the he-goat; I know from my own experience.
All the different kinds of oxen, therefore, are
no more than one species, and all the sheep
but another, however extended the genus of
both may be.</p>

<p>I shall never cease to repeat (seeing the importance
of the subject) that it is not by trivial
particular characters we can judge of Nature,
or distinguish the species; that methodical
arrangements, far from elucidating the History
of Animals, serve but to obscure it by multiplying
unnecessary denominations and species;
by making arbitrary genera which are not in
Nature, and perpetually confounding real
beings with imaginary creatures; by giving
false ideas of the characteristics of the species,
and mixing or separating them without foundation,
without knowledge, and often without
having seen a single individual. It is hence
that our nomenclators constantly deceive
themselves, and write almost as many errors
as lines. We have already given so many
examples of this, that he must be blindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
prejudiced indeed, that can in the least doubt
them. Monsieur Gmelin speaks very sensibly
on this subject, when treating of the animal in
question.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Vide Voyage Ã  Kamtschatka, par M. Gmelin.</p></div>

<p>We are convinced, as M. Gmelin observes,
that we cannot acquire a knowledge of Nature,
but by making a judicious use of our senses, by
reflecting, seeing, comparing, and, at the same
time, by rejecting the bold freedom of forming
methodical orders, and minute systems, in
which animals are classed without the authors
having seen them, and of which they are only
acquainted with the names; names which are
often equivocal, obscure, and misapplied.
The wrong use of these names confounds the
ideas in vague and indefinite words, and drowns
the truth in a torrent of error. We are also
convinced, after having compared the living
mouflon with the description of M. Gmelin,
that the argali is the same animal. We have
said they are found in Europe, and in warm
countries, such as Greece, the island of Cyprus,
Sardinia, and Corsica; nevertheless, they
are found also, and in great numbers, in all
the mountains of the southern parts of Siberia,
under a climate rather cold than temperate,
and where they appear even to be
bigger, stronger, and more vigorous. He
might, therefore, have stocked the north and
south parts, and his posterity have become domestic;
after having long endured the rigours
of this condition, he might have degenerated,
taking relative characters, and new habits of
body, according to the different climates, and
the different treatments he has received; which
being afterwards perpetuated by generation,
have given rise to our domestic, and all other
kinds of sheep, of which we have heretofore
spoken.</p>

<p>In the year 1774, a ram was exhibited at
the fair of St. Germain, as a ram of the Cape
of Good Hope; but we found it had been
purchased at Tunis, and considered it to be
of the same species as the Barbary sheep, (<i>fig.</i>
141.) before mentioned, for it differed only by
the head and tail being somewhat more short
and thick; yet by way of distinction, we have
called it the ram of Tunis. (<a href="#FIG_142"><i>fig. 142.</i></a>) His
legs were shorter than those of our common
sheep; he was plentifully clothed with wool,
and his horns both in size and shape nearly resembled
the Barbary sheep. In the same
year, and at the same place, there was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
another shewn under the name of the Morvant
of China, (<a href="#FIG_143"><i>fig. 143.</i></a>) which was remarkable
for having a sort of mane on his neck,
and long hairs hanging down under his throat,
which were a mixture of red and grey, and
full ten inches long; the mane extended to
about the middle of the back, the hairs of
which were not so long as those under the
throat, were more red, mixed with a few
brown and black ones; the wool which covered
the other part of the body was rather
curled, near three inches long, and of a bright
yellow; his legs were red, spotted with yellow,
and his tail yellow and white; he was
not so high as the common rams, and more
resembled the Indian rams than them; he had
a very large belly, in appearance like that of
an ewe with young, and his horns were like
those of the common kind.</p>

<p>From what we have since observed we are
the more convinced in our former opinion,
that the muflon is the original stock of all
other sheep, and that he has a constitution
sufficiently strong to live either in cold, temperate,
or warm climates. M. Steller says,
that the rams of Kamtschatka have the manner
of the goat, and the hair of the rein-deer;
that some of their horns weigh more than thirty
pounds; that they are as active as roe-bucks,
and live upon the edges of mountains,
that their flesh is good, but they are principally
hunted for their skins.</p>

<p>There remain but very few real muflons in
Corsica, the many wars in that island having
probably been the cause of their destruction,
but the present race of sheep still retain a resemblance
to them in their figures, as I observed
to be the case in one I saw in August,
1774, belonging to the Duc de VrilliÃ©re.</p>

<p>This animal being only known by the
vague names of the <i>hind</i> of <i>Sardinia</i>, and the
<i>deer</i> of the <i>Ganges</i>, we have preserved the
name given him by Belon, and which he borrowed
from Pliny; because, the character of
Pliny&rsquo;s axis agrees with this animal, and the
name has never been applied to any other; and,
therefore, we are not afraid of falling into confusion
or error, for a generic denomination,
joined to an epithet derived from the climate,
is not a name, but a phrase, by which we may
confound one animal with others of his genus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as this with the stag, although, perhaps, it is
really distinct both in species and climate.
The axis (<a href="#FIG_144"><i>fig. 144.</i></a>) is one of the small number
of ruminating animals who has horns like the
stag. He has the shape and swiftness of the
fallow-deer. But what distinguishes him from
both is, his having the horns of the former,
and figure of the latter; his body is marked
with white spots,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> elegantly disposed, and separated
one from another; and lastly, he is a
native of warm countries;<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> while the stag
and fallow-deer have their coats generally of
a uniform colour, and are to be met with in
greater numbers in cold and temperate regions
than in warm climates.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> The axis is about the size of the fallow-deer, the ground
colour of his body is a greyish yellow beautifully marked
with white spots; his belly is white, as is also the under part
of his tail, while the upper inclines to red.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> I never saw, at Senegal, any stag with horns like those
in France. <i>Voyage de le Maire.</i>&mdash;There are stags in the peninsula
of India, on this side the Ganges, whose bodies are
interspersed with white spots. <i>Voyage de la Compagnie des
Indes de Hollande.</i>&mdash;There are stags at Bengal spotted like
tigers. <i>Voyage de Luillier.</i></p></div>

<p>The gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences
have given the figure and description of the
interior parts of this animal, but say very little
of his exterior form, and nothing with respect
to his history. They have only called him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the <i>Sardinian hind</i>, because, probably, they
received that name from the royal menagerie,
where there is one of them; but there is no
proof of this animal&rsquo;s being a native of Sardinia.
No author has mentioned that he exists
in that island, as a wild animal; but on the
contrary, we see by the passages we have quoted,
that he is found in the warmest countries
of Asia. Thus the denomination of <i>Sardinian
hind</i>, has been falsely applied; that of the
<i>Ganges stag</i> agrees best, if he really were of
the same species as the stag, since that part of
India, which the Ganges waters, appears to be
his native country. He is also to be met with
in Barbary, and, it is probable, that the spotted
fallow-deer of the Cape of Good Hope, is
the same animal.</p>

<p>We have already remarked, that no species
approaches so near each other, as that of the
fallow-deer to the stag: nevertheless, the axis
appears to be an intermediate shade between
the two. He resembles the fallow-deer in the
size of his body, length of his tail, and his
coat, which is the same during his whole
life: the only essential difference is in his
horns, which nearly resemble those of the
stag. The axis, therefore, may be only a
variety depending on the climate, and not a
different species from that of the fallow-deer;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for, although he is a native of the warmest
countries of Asia, he exists and multiplies
easily in Europe. There are many herds of
them in the royal menagerie; and they produce
together as freely as the fallow-deer. It
has never, however, been observed, that they
mix either with the fallow-deer, or with the
stags, and this is the cause of our presuming,
that they are not a variety of one or the other,
but a particular and intermediate species.
But as no direct and decisive experiments on
this subject have yet been made, and as no
necessary means has been used to oblige these
animals to unite, we will not positively affirm
that they are two different species.</p>

<p>We have already seen, under the articles of
stag and fallow-deer, how many instances these
animals give of varieties, especially in the colour
of their hair. The species of the fallow-deer
and stag, without being very numerous
in individuals, is universally diffused; both
are met with in either continent, and both are
subject to a great number of varieties, which
appear to form lasting kinds. The white stags,
which are a very ancient race, since the Greeks
and Romans mention them, and the small
brown stags, which we have called <i>Corsican
stags</i>, are not the only varieties of this species.
There is in Germany another race, known in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that country by the name of <i>Brandhertz</i>, and by
our hunters by that of the <i>Stag of Ardennes</i>.
This stag is larger than a common stag, and
differs from other stags not only by its deeper
colour, being almost black, but also by long
hair upon the shoulders and on the throat.
This kind of mane and beard give him some
affinity, the first to the horse, and the latter to
the goat. The ancients have given to this
stag the compound names of <i>Hippelaphus</i> and
<i>Tragelaphus</i>. As these denominations have
occasioned critical discussions, in which the
most learned naturalists are not agreed, and as
Gesner, Caius, and others, have said, that the
hippelaphus was the rein-deer, we shall here
give the reasons which have occasioned us to
think differently, and have led us to suppose
that the hippelaphus of Aristotle is the same
animal as the tragelaphus of Pliny, and that
both these names equally denote the stag of
Ardennes.</p>

<p>Aristotle gives to his hippelaphus a kind
of mane upon the neck and upon the upper
part of the shoulders, a beard under the
throat, horns to the male resembling those of
the roe-bucks, and no horns to the female.
He says, that the hippelaphus is of the size
of a stag, and is found among the Arachotas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a people of India, where wild oxen are
also to be met with, whose bodies are robust,
their skins black, their muzzles raised, and
their horns bent more backwards than those
of the domestic oxen. It must be acknowledged,
that Aristotle&rsquo;s characters of the hippelaphus,
agree nearly with those of the
rein-deer and the stag of Ardennes; they
both have long hair upon the neck and shoulders,
and also on the throat, which forms
a kind of beard on the gullet, and not on
the chin; but the hippelaphus, being only
of the size of the stag, differs in that from
the rein-deer, who is much larger: and what
appears to me decisive on the question is,
that the rein-deer being an animal belonging
to cold countries, never existed among the
Arachotas. The country of the Arachotas
is one of the provinces which Alexander travelled
over in his expedition into India; it
is situated beyond Mount Caucasus, between
Persia and India. This hot climate never
produced any rein-deer, as they cannot exist
even in temperate countries, and are only to
be met with in the northern regions of both
continents. Stags, on the contrary, are not
particularly attached to the north, but are to
be found in great numbers in warm and temperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
climates. Thus we cannot doubt but
the hippelaphus of Aristotle, which is met
with among the Arachotas, and in the same
countries with the buffalo, is the stag of Ardennes,
and not the rein-deer.</p>

<p>If we now compare what Pliny says upon
the tragelaphus with what Aristotle says upon
the hippelaphus, and both with Nature, we
shall find, that the tragelaphus is the same animal
as the hippelaphus, and therefore the same
as our stag of Ardennes. Pliny says, that the
tragelaphus is of the stag species,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> and only
differs from him by the beard and the hair on
his shoulders. These characters are positive,
and can only be applied to the stag of Ardennes;
for Pliny speaks elsewhere of the rein-deer
under the name of <i>AlcÃ©</i>. We think ourselves,
therefore, sufficiently warranted to pronounce,
that the tragelaphus of Pliny, and the
hippelapus of Aristotle, both denote the animal
we call the <i>Stag of Ardennes</i>; and that the axis
of Pliny is the animal commonly called the
<i>Ganges Stag</i>. Though names have no influence
on Nature, yet an explication of them is
doing service to those who study her productions.</p>

<p>In a letter I received from Mr. Colinson, in
1765, he informed me that the Duke of Richmond
had several of the species of the Ganges
Stags, or, as I have called it, Axis, in his park;
that they lived familiarly with the fallow-deer,
did not form separate herds, but even propagated
together, and that from the intermixture
beautiful varieties were produced.</p>

<p>There was a male and female Chinese fallow-deer
in the royal menagerie in the year
1764; they were above two feet four inches in
height; they were dark brown on the body and
tail, mixed in several places with large yellow
hairs, and yellow on the belly and legs. Though
smaller than either the fallow-deer or axis, it
was probably only a variety of the latter, and
with whom it might intermix and be perpetuated
even in France, especially as they are
both natives of the eastern regions of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>The Tapir (<a href="#FIG_146"><i>fig. 146.</i></a>) is the largest animal
in America, of that New World, where,
as we have before observed, animated Nature
seems to be lessened, or rather has not had
time to arrive at its full dimensions. In place
of the colossal masses, which the ancient lands
of Asia produce; instead of the elephant, rhinoceros,
hippopotamus, camel, &amp;c. we only
meet in these new countries with animals
modelled upon a small scale; the tapir, lama,
pacos, and cabiais, are above twenty times
smaller than those they should be compared
with in the old continent. Matter is not only
used here with prodigious parsimony, but even
the forms are imperfect, and appear to have
failed or been neglected. The animals of South
America, which alone properly belong to this
new continent, are almost all without tusks,
horns, and tails; their figure is grotesque,
their bodies and limbs ill proportioned, and
some, as the ant-eaters, sloth, &amp;c. are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
miserably formed, that they scarcely have the
faculties of moving or of eating; with pain
they drag on a languishing life in the solitude
of a desart, and cannot subsist in the inhabited
regions, where man and powerful animals
would have soon destroyed them.</p>

<p>The tapir is of the size of a small cow or
zebu, but without horns or tail; his legs are
short, and his body arched like that of a hog.
When young his coat is spotted like that of
the stag, and afterwards becomes of an uniform
dark brown colour. His head is thick
and long, with a kind of trunk like the rhinoceros;
he has ten cutting teeth, and ten grinders,
in each jaw; a character which separates
him entirely from the ox, and other ruminating
animals. As we have only some skins
of this animal, and a drawing which M. de la
Condamine favoured us with, we cannot do
better than refer to the descriptions given of
him from life, by Marcgrave<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> and Barrere<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>,
at the same time, subjoining what travellers
and historians have said concerning him.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> The tapir, or, as he is sometimes called, the Maipouri,
is an amphibious animal, being as much in the water as on
land; he has very short hair, interspersed with black and
white hairs. <i>Nat. Hist. par Barrere.</i></p></div>

<p>The tapir appears to be a dull and gloomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
animal, who never stirs out but in the night,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
and delights in the water, where he oftener lives
than upon land: he chiefly lives in marshes, and
seldom goes far from the borders of rivers or
lakes. When alarmed, pursued, or wounded,
he plunges into the water, and remains under
it until he has passed to a considerable distance.
These customs, which he has in common with,
the hippopotamus, have made some naturalists
imagine him to be of the same species; but
they differ as much from each other in nature
as the climates are distant which they inhabit.
To be assured of this, there needs no more
than to compare the descriptions we have recited,
with those we have given of the hippopotamus.
Although the tapir inhabits the water,
he does not feed upon fish; and although
his mouth is armed with twenty sharp and incisive
teeth, he is not carnivorous. He lives
upon plants and roots, and makes no use of
his weapons against other animals. He is of a
mild and timid nature, and flies from every
attack or danger. His legs are short, and his
body heavy, but, notwithstanding, he runs
very swift, and swims still better than he runs.
His skin is of a very firm texture, and so bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
together that it often resists a bullet. His flesh
is insipid and coarse; nevertheless the Indians
eat it. They commonly go in companies, and
are found in Brasil, Paraguay, Guiana, and
in all the extent of South America, from the
extremity of Chili to New Spain.</p>

in the night, but he is also to be met with in the day.</p></div>

<p>The Zebra (<a href="#FIG_146"><i>fig. 146.</i></a>) is perhaps the handsomest
and most elegant of all quadrupeds. He
has the figure and gracefulness of the horse,
with the swiftness of the stag. His striped robe
of black and white ribbands, is alternately disposed
with so much regularity and symmetry,
that it seems as if nature had made use of the
rule and compass. The alternate bands of
black and white, are the more singular, as they
are strait, parallel, and as exactly divided, as
those of a striped stuff; besides they extend not
only over the body, but over the head, thighs,
legs, and even the ears and tail; so that, at a
distance, this animal appears as if he was
adorned with ribbands, disposed in a regular
and elegant manner over every part of the body.
In the females, these bands are alternately black
and white; in the males they are black and
yellow; but the shades are always lively and
brilliant, upon a short, fine, and thick hair, the
lustre of which increases the beauty of the colours.
The zebra, in general, is less than the
horse, and bigger than the ass. Although he
has often been compared to these two animals,
by the names of the <i>wild horse</i> and the <i>striped
ass</i>, he is a copy of neither, but might rather
be called their model, if all were not equally
original in Nature, and if every species had
not an equal right to creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The zebra, then, is neither a horse nor an
ass, for we have never learnt that he intermixes
with either, though trials have often been made
for that purpose. She-asses, when in heat,
were presented to the zebra, which was in the
menagerie of Versailles, in the year 1761; but
he disdained them, or rather, shewed no sign
of emotions; he played with, and even mounted
on them, but without any external marks
of desire; and this coldness could be attributed
to no other cause than the disagreement of
their natures; for this zebra was then four
years of age, and was very lively and alert in
every other exercise.</p>

<p>The zebra is not the animal the ancients have
mentioned under the name of <i>onagre</i>. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Levant, in the eastern parts of Asia, and in the
north of Africa, there exists a beautiful race of
asses, which, like the finest horses, are natives
of Arabia. This race differs from the common
kind, by the largeness of the body, the slenderness
of the legs, and the lustre of the hair.
They are of an uniform colour, commonly of
a fine mouse grey, with a black cross on the
back and shoulders, sometimes they are of a
bright grey, with a flaxen cross. These asses
of Africa and Asia, although more beautiful
than those of Europe, are originally, and
equally descended from the <i>onagres</i>, or <i>wild
asses</i>, which are still in great plenty in East
and South Tartary, Persia, Syria, the islands
of the Archipelago, and all Mauritania. The
onagres differ from our domestic asses only by
the qualities resulting from freedom and independence:
they are stronger and swifter, and
have more courage and vivacity; the form of
their body is the same, but they have longer
hair, and this difference varies again according
to their condition, for our asses would have
hair equally long, if it was not cut off at the
age of four or five months. The hair of
young asses is at first nearly as long as that of
young bears. The hide of the wild ass is also
harder than that of the domestic kind, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
are informed that it is covered with small
tubercules, and it is even said that the <i>shagreen</i>
brought from the Levant, and which we employ
for so many purposes, is made of these
wild asses skin. But neither the onagres, nor
the beautiful asses of Arabia, can be looked
upon as the stock of the zebra species, though
they resemble them in figure and swiftness.
That regular variety of the climate of the
zebra has never been exhibited by either of
them. This beautiful species is singular, and
very distant from any other. The zebra is
also of a different climate from the onagre,
being only to be met with in the most eastern
and southern parts of Africa, from Ethiopia to
the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence into
Congo. He exists neither in Europe, Asia,
America, nor in the northern parts of Africa.
Those, which some travellers tell us they saw
at the Brasils, had been transported thither
from Africa. Others, which have been seen
in Persia and in Turkey, have been brought
thither from Ethiopia; and, in short, those
which we have seen in Europe come almost
entirely from the Cape of Good Hope. This
point of Africa is their native climate, and
where the Dutch have employed all their endeavours
to tame and render them domestic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
without having hitherto been able to succeed.
That which was the subject of this description
was very wild when he arrived at the royal
menagerie in France, and is not yet entirely
tamed; nevertheless, he has been brought to
let a man sit on a saddle, but great precaution
is necessary, as two men are obliged to hold
the bridle while the third is on his back. His
mouth is very hard; his ears are so sensible
that he winces whenever they are touched. He
is restive, like a vicious horse, and obstinate as
a mule. But, perhaps, the wild horse, and the
onagre, are equally untractable, and, possibly,
if the zebra was accustomed to obedience, and
to a domestic state, from his earliest days, he
might become as gentle as the ass or the horse,
and might be substituted in their room.</p>

<p>Although the ass is to be met with,
either in a wild, or domestic state, in almost
every country of the old continent, under a
warm or temperate climate, yet there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
such animal in the new, upon its first discovery.
They were, however, soon after transported
from Europe, and multiplied so fast in America,
that they may be said to be equally numerous
in the four quarters of the globe; but
it is not so with the zebra; he seems confined
to the southern parts of Africa, and especially
about the Cape of Good Hope, although
Lopez has asserted that they are more abundant
in Barbary than in Congo, and Dapper
says the same in favour of the forests of
Angola.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the superiority this animal
maintains over the ass, from the elegance of
his figure, and beauty of colours, yet he appears
to be somewhat of the same species, for almost
all travellers have given it the name of striped
ass, from being struck at the first sight with
his having a greater resemblance to the ass
than the horse; it is not, however, with the
common ass that they compared him, but
that large and beautiful part of the species
we have before alluded to; I am, notwithstanding,
inclined to the opinion, that the
zebra makes a nearer approach to the species
of the horse, as he possesses a similar elegance
of figure. In favour of this opinion it has
been observed, near the Cape of Good Hope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which appears to be the native country of the
zebra, but there are horses spotted on the back
and bellies, with yellow, black, red, and blue.
We will not, however, pretend to undertake
the decision of this question; but as the Dutch
have transported a number of these animals to
Holland, and even yoked them in the Stadtholder&rsquo;s
chariot, there is some hopes that their
nature will soon be clearly exemplified. In
Holland there are many judicious naturalists,
and, therefore, we cannot suppose they will
fail to make these animals unite among
themselves, if not with the horse and the ass:
for that attempted in the royal menagerie in
1761, was but a single experiment; it is
possible, that as the zebra was but four years
old he might not have arrived to maturity, at
all events he was not rendered familiar with the
females presented to him, a circumstance,
which seems requisite throughout nature, even
in an intercourse with individuals of the same
species.</p>

<p>In Tartary they have an animal called <i>czigithai</i>,
which possibly is of the same species as
the zebra, as the principal difference between
them is in the colour; a difference which, we
have repeatedly observed, may be occasioned
by the varieties of the climates. This czigithai
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
is common in the southern parts of Siberia,
Thibet, Dauria, and Tartary. Gerbillan says
they are to be met with in the country of the
Mongoux and Kakas; that they differ from
mules, and cannot be brought to carry burthens.
Muller and Gmelin both assert that
there are numbers of them in the countries of
the Tongusians, who hunt them like other
game: that they resemble a bright bay horse,
excepting they have long ears, and a tail like
a cow. It is probable that if they had compared
him with the zebra they would have
found a much greater resemblance. In the
Petersburgh cabinet there are stuffed skins
both of the zebra and czigithai; they differ
very much in colour, but yet they may belong
to the same, or nearly the same species. Besides
there is no other animal in Africa but what is
to be found in Asia, and, therefore, if these are
different species the zebra alone would stand
as an exception to that general rule. If the
czigithai does not belong to the zebra species
it may possibly be the onagre, or wild ass of
Asia; which latter should not by any means
be confounded with the zebra. According to
all travellers there are various kinds of wild
asses, and the onagre is supposed to rank at the
head of them. The horse, ass, onagre, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
czigithai, may form four distinct species; and
if there are but three, it will remain uncertain
whether the latter is an onagre or zebra. The
onagre is said to exceed the horse in swiftness,
and the very same remark is made of the
czigithai. Let this particular fact be as it
may, the horse, ass, zebra, and czigithai, belong
to the same genus, and are only different
branches thereof. From the two first being
rendered domestic, mankind have received
great advantages, and the two last being reduced
to a similar state would, no doubt,
prove likewise a useful acquisition.</p>

<p>Though the Hippopotamus has been
celebrated from the earliest ages; though mentioned
in the sacred writings under the name
of <i>behemoth</i>, and though his figure is engraved
upon the obelisks of Egypt, and on the Roman
medals; yet he was but imperfectly known to
the ancients. Aristotle scarcely mentions him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and in the little he does say, there are more
errors than facts. Pliny copied Aristotle, and
far from correcting, adds to the number of his
errors. It was only towards the middle of the
sixteenth century that we had any precise information
concerning this animal; Belon being
then at Constantinople, saw a living one; of
which, however, he has given but an imperfect
representation, for the two figures which
he has joined to his description, were not taken
from the hippopotamus he has seen, but were
copied from the reverse of a medal of the
Emperor Adrian, and from the colossus of the
Nile at Rome; so that we must carry the
epoch of the knowledge of this animal to the
year 1603, when Frederico Zerenghi, a surgeon
of Narni, in Italy, printed at Naples, the history
of two of these animals, which he had
killed in Egypt, in a great ditch he had caused
to be dug in the environs of the Nile, near
Damietta. This little work was written in
Italian, and appears to have been neglected by
his contemporary and succeeding naturalists;
notwithstanding, it is the only good and original
one on the subject, and has so strong
pretensions to credit, that I shall here give an
extract and translation from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a view of obtaining an hippopotamus,
(says Zerenghi) I suborned the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
about the Nile, (who had seen two of these
animals come from the river) to dig a large
pit in the place where they passed over, and
to cover it with light wood, earth, and grass.
Returning in the evening to the river, they
both fell into the pit. The people came immediately
and acquainted me with the event,
and I hastened thither with my Janissary. We
killed both the animals by firing three charges
from a large arquebuse into each of their heads.
They expired immediately, uttering a doleful
cry, which more resembled the bellowing of a
buffalo, than the neighing of a horse. This
exploit was performed on the 20th of July,
1600. The following day I had them drawn
out of the pit, and skinned with care; the one
was a male and the other a female. I had both
the skins salted, and filled with the leaves of the
sugar cane, in order to transport them to Cairo,
where I had them salted a second time with
greater attention and more convenience. In
doing of which we used near 400lbs. of salt to
each skin. At my return from Egypt, in 1601,
I brought these skins to Venice, and from thence
to Rome. I shewed them to many learned
physicians. Doctor Jerome Aquapendente and
the celebrated Aldrovandus, were the only
persons who knew them to be the skins of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hippopotamus; and as the work of Aldrovandus
was then printing, he had (with my consent)
a figure drawn from the skin of the female,
which he has given with his book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hippopotamus has a very thick and
hard skin; it is impenetrable, unless it be
soaked some time in water: the mouth is not,
as the ancients have said, of a moderate size,
but enormously large; neither are his feet as
they say, divided into two hoofs, but into
four. His size is not that of an ass, for he is
much bigger than the largest horse, or buffalo;
he has not a tail like that of the hog, but
rather that of the tortoise, except being incomparably
larger; his mouth or nose is not elevated,
but resembles that of the buffalo, and is
much larger; he has no mane like the horse,
but only some short hairs; he does not neigh
like the horse, but his voice is between the
bellowing of the buffalo, and the neighing of
the former. His teeth do not jut out of his
mouth, for when it is shut, the teeth, although
extremely large, are all hid under the lips.
The inhabitants of this part of Egypt call him
<i>foras l&rsquo;bar</i>, which signifies a <i>sea-horse</i>. Belon
is much deceived in his description of this
animal, he attributes to him teeth like those of
a horse, which would induce me to think he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had never seen him, although, as he tells us
he had, for the teeth of the hippopotamus are
very large and very singular. To clear up
every doubt and uncertainty, continues Zerenghi,
I have here given the figure of the female
hippopotamus; every proportion has
been taken exactly after nature, as well as the
measure of its body and limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The length of this hippopotamus, from the
extremity of the upper lip to the beginning of
the tail, is nearly eleven feet two inches.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> This measurement is according, to Paris feet and inches.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;The circumference of the body is about
ten feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The height, from the bottom of the
foot to the top of the back, is four feet five
inches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The circumference of the legs near the
shoulders is two feet nine inches; and taken
lower, is one foot nine inches and a half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The height of the legs, from the bottom
of the feet to the breast, is one foot ten inches
and a half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The length of the feet, from the extremity
of the nails, is about four inches and a half.&mdash;<i>Note.</i>
I have taken the medium measure between
the two that Zerenghi gives, for the
length of the feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The nails are as long as they are broad,
being rather more than two inches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one nail on each toe, and four
toes on each foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skin upon the back is nearly an inch,
and that upon the belly about half an inch
thick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skin is so hard when dried, that it
cannot be pierced by a musket shot. The people
of the country make great shields of it, and
cut it into thongs or kind of whips. On the
surface of the skin there are a few very fine
hairs of a greyish colour, and which cannot
be perceived at first sight; on the neck there are
some longer, but they are all placed one by
one, more or less distant from each other; but
on the lips they form a kind of mustachio:
for there springs out ten or twelve of them
from the same points; these hairs are of the
same colour as the rest, they are only harder,
thicker, and somewhat longer, though the
longest is not more than half an inch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The length of the tail is rather more than
eleven inches, and its circumference, taken at
the beginning, is something more than a foot,
and at its extremity, is two inches and upwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tail is not round, but from the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to the end is flat, like an eel. Upon the
tail and the thighs, there are some round scales
of a whitish colour, broad as a French bean;
these small scales are also seen upon the breast,
the neck, and upon some parts of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The head, from the extremity of the lips
to the beginning of the neck, is two feet four
inches, and its circumference about five feet
eight inches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ears are two inches and near an half
long, more than two inches in breadth, are a
little pointed, and furnished on the inside with
thick, short, and fine hairs, of the same colour
as the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The space between each angle of the eyes
is two inches and upwards, and from one eyelid
to the other, is one inch and one line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nostrils are two inches four lines
long, and little more than one inch broad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mouth, when open, measures about
one foot six inches; it is of a square form, and
furnished with forty-four teeth of different
shapes. All these teeth are so hard, that they
strike fire with steel. The enamel of the canine
teeth in particular, have this hardness;
the interior substance being not so hard.
When the hippopotamus keeps his mouth
shut there are no teeth to be seen, for the lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which are extremely large, completely cover
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In respect to the figure of this animal, it
may be said to be constructed between that of
the buffalo and hog, because it participates of
both, except the incisive teeth, which have no
resemblance to those of either of these animals.
The grinders are a little like those of the buffalo
or horse, but much larger. The colour
of the body is dark and blackish. It is affirmed
that the hippopotamus produces but one
young at a birth; that he lives on fish, crocodiles,
and even the flesh of dead bodies; however,
he eats rice, grain, &amp;c. though on considering
his teeth, we should conclude that
Nature had not made him for grazing, but
for the destruction of other animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zerenghi finishes his description by affirming
that all the above measures were taken from
the female hippopotamus, whom the male perfectly
resembled, excepting that he was a third
bigger in all his dimensions. It were to be
wished that the figure given by Zerenghi had
been as good as his description; but the drawing
was not taken while this animal was living,
but from the skin of the female. It appears
also, that it was from this same skin preserved
in salt, that Fabius Columna designed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
figure; but the description Columna has given,
is not so good as that of Zerenghi&rsquo;s, and he
must be reproached for only quoting the name
and not a word about the work of this author,
though published three years before his own:
he must also be accused of swerving from his
description in many essential points, without
giving any reason for it; for example, Columna
says, that in his time, in 1603, Frederico
Zerenghi brought from Egypt to Italy an
hippopotamus preserved in salt, while Zerenghi
himself says, he brought only the skin.
Columna also gives to his hippopotamus thirteen
feet in length, to the circumference fourteen,
and the legs three feet and a half long;
while the measures of Zerenghi makes the
length of the body but eleven feet two inches,
the circumference ten, and the legs one foot
ten inches and a half, &amp;c. We must not,
therefore, rely on the description of Columna;
nor excuse him upon the supposition that he
took it from another subject; for it is evident,
from his own words, that he made it from
the smallest of Zerenghi&rsquo;s two hippopotami;
since he acknowledges that some months after
Zerenghi shewed a second hippopotamus
much larger than the first. What makes me
so strenuous on this point is, that no one has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rendered justice to Zerenghi, who, notwithstanding,
is the only person who deserves
eulogiums on this subject. On the contrary,
every naturalist, for this hundred and sixty
years, have attributed to Fabius Columna
what they should have given to Zerenghi;
and instead of searching for the work of the
last they have set down contented with copying
and applauding that of Columna&rsquo;s, who,
however deserving of praise in other respects
is, upon this, neither original, exact, nor even
honest.</p>

<p>The description and figures of the hippopotamus
that Prosper Alpinus published more
than a hundred years after, are still worse than
those of Columna, having been drawn from
skins but badly preserved; and M. de Jussieu,
who wrote of the hippopotamus in 1724, has
only described the skeleton of the head and
feet.</p>

<p>By comparing these descriptions, and especially
that of Zerenghi, with the information
we have drawn from travellers, the hippopotamus
appears to be an animal whose body is
longer and as thick as that of the rhinoceros;
that his legs are much shorter; that his head
is not so long, but larger in proportion to his
body: that he has no horns, either on the
nose like the rhinoceros, or on the head like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the ruminating animals. His cry when hurt,
according to ancient and modern travellers,
resembles the neighing of a horse and the
bellowing of the buffalo; his usual voice
may be like the neighing of a horse, from
which, however, he differs in every other respect.
If thus be the fact, we may presume
that this resemblance in the voice has been the
reason for giving him the name of <i>hippopotamus</i>,
which signifies the <i>river horse</i>, as the howling
of the lynx, which resembles that of the wolf,
occasioned him to be called the <i>lupus cervarius</i>.
The cutting teeth of the hippopotamus, and
especially the two canine of the lower jaw,
are very long, and so hard and strong that they
strike fire with a piece of steel. This is
probably what, gave rise to the fable of the
ancients, that the hippopotamus vomited fire:
these canine teeth are so white, so clean, and
so hard, that they are preferable to ivory for
making artificial teeth. The cutting teeth,
especially those of the lower jaw, are very long,
cylindrical and furrowed; the canine teeth are
also very long, crooked, prismatic, and sharp,
like the tusks of a boar: the grinders are
square, or rather oblong, nearly like those of a
man, and so large that a single one weighs
more than three pounds; the largest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cutting, and the canine teeth are twelve and
even sixteen inches in length, and sometimes
weigh twelve or thirteen pounds each.</p>

<p>In short, to give a just idea of the size of the
hippopotamus we shall make use of Zerenghi&rsquo;s
measures, increasing them one third, because
his measures were taken from the female, who
was one third less than the male in all her dimensions.
This male hippopotamus was consequently
sixteen feet nine inches long, from
the extremity of the muzzle to the beginning
of the tail; fifteen feet in circumference, and
six feet and a half in height; his legs were
about two feet ten inches long; the length of
the head three feet and a half, and eight feet
and a half in circumference ; the width of
the mouth two feet four inches, and the largest
teeth more than a foot long.</p>

<p>Thus powerfully armed, and with such prodigious
strength of body, he might render
himself formidable to every animal; but he is
naturally gentle, and is besides so heavy and
slow that he could not outrun any other quadruped.
He swims quicker than he runs, pursues
the fish, and makes them his prey. He
delights much in the water, and lives in it as
freely as upon land, yet he has no membranes
between his toes like the beaver and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
otter, and it is plain, that the great ease with
which he swims is owing to the great capacity
of his body, which makes his specific gravity
nearly equal to the water. Besides, he remains
a long time under water, and walks at
the bottom as well as in the open air; and
when he quits it to graze upon land he eats
sugar-canes, rushes, millet, rice, roots, &amp;c. of
which he consumes great quantities, and does
much injury to cultivated lands; but as he is
more timid on land than in the water he is
very easily driven away, and his legs are so
short that he cannot save himself by flight, if
he be far from any water. His resource, when
in danger, is to plunge into the water, and
proceed under it to a great distance before he
reappears. He commonly retreats from his
pursuers, when hunted, but if wounded he becomes
irritated, and faces about with great
fury, rushes against the boats, seizes them with
his teeth, tears pieces off, and sometimes sinks
them. &ldquo;I have seen, says a traveller,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> an
hippopotamus open his mouth, fix one tooth
on the gunnel of a boat, and another on the
second plank under the keel (that is at least
four feet distant), pierce the side through and
through, and in this manner sink the boat. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have seen one lying by the side of the sea-shore,
upon whom the waves tossed a Dutch boat
heavily laden, and then retreating left it dry
on his back, and which was afterwards carried
off again by another wave, without the animal
appearing to have received the least injury. I
could not discover the exact arrangement of
his teeth, but they appear to form the figure
of a bow, and were about sixteen inches long.
We fired several times at one of them, but the
shot rebounded from his skin. The natives
consider him as a kind of deity, and that he
cannot be destroyed, and frequently declare, if
they were to use him as we do he would soon
be the destruction of their nets and canoes.
When they go a fishing in their canoes, and
meet with an hippopotamus, they throw fish
to him, and then he passes on without disturbing
their fishery any more. He does the most
injury when he can rest himself against the
earth, but when he floats in the water he can
only bite. Once, when our boat lay near the
shore, I saw one of them get underneath, lift
her above water upon his back, and overset her
with six men aboard, but fortunately they received
no hurt.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;We dare not, says
another traveller, irritate the hippopotamus in
the water, since an adventure that had nearly
proved fatal to three men; they had proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in a small canoe to attack one in a river
where there was about ten feet water; they
discovered him walking at the bottom, according
to his usual custom, and wounded him
with a long lance, upon which he rose immediately
to the surface of the water, looked at
them with a dreadful aspect, and, at one bite,
took a great piece out of the side of the canoe,
which had very nearly overturned it, and it
was with difficulty they could make the shore.&rdquo;
These two examples are sufficient to give an
idea of the strength of these animals; and a
number of like facts are to be met with in the
General History of Voyages, by the AbbÃ©
Prevost, who has given a summary of whatever
travellers have reported concerning the
hippopotamus.</p>

<p>These animals are not numerous, except in
particular places, and it even appears that
they are confined to the rivers of Africa.
The greatest part of naturalists have said, that
the hippopotamus is to be found also in the
Indies, but the evidence they have of this circumstance
is very equivocal; the most positive
would be that of Alexander, in his letter
to Aristotle, if we could assure ourselves, that
the animals of which Alexander speaks, were
really hippopotami. What occasions me to
have some doubts on this head is, that Aristotle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in describing the hippopotamus in his
history of animals, must have said, that they
were natives of India, as well as Egypt, if he
had thought that the animal, of which Alexander
speaks in his letter, had been the true
hippopotamus. Onesicritus, and some other
authors, say the hippopotamus is to be found in
the river Indus, but modern travellers, at least
those who merit most confidence, have not
confirmed this fact; they all agree, that this
animal is found in the Nile, the Senegal, or
Niger, the Gambia, the Zara, and other great
rivers and lakes of Africa, especially in the
southern and eastern parts. Father Boyn is
the only one who seems to insinuate that the
hippopotamus is to be met with in Asia, but
his recital appears suspicious, and I think only
proves that he is common in Mosambique,
and all the eastern parts of Africa. At present
the hippopotamus, which is called the <i>Nile-horse</i>,
is so rare in the lower Nile, that the
inhabitants of Egypt have no idea of the name.
He is equally unknown in all the northern
parts of Africa, from the Mediterranean to the
Bamboo river, which flows at the foot of
Mount Atlas; the climate which the hippopotamus
actually inhabits, therefore extends
only from Senegal to Ethiopia, and from
thence to the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>As most authors have called the hippopotamus
the <i>sea-horse</i>, or <i>sea-cow</i>, it has sometimes
been confounded with the latter, which
is a very different animal, and which only inhabits
the northern seas. It appear, then, to
be certain, that the hippopotami, which the
author of the description of Muscovy says
are found upon the borders of the sea of
Petzora, are no other than sea-cows, and Aldrovandus
merits reproach for adopting this
opinion without examination, and asserting that
the hippopotamus is found in the northern
seas: for he not only does not inhabit the north
seas, but it appears that he is rarely found in
those of the south. The testimonies of Odoardus,
Barbossa, and Edward Wotton, recounted
by Aldrovandus, and which seem to prove that
the hippopotamus inhabits the Indian seas,
appear to be almost as equivocal as that in the
description of Muscovy; and I am inclined to
believe that the hippopotamus is not to be
found, at least at present, but in the greatest
rivers of Africa. Kolbe, who says, he has
seen many of them at the Cape of Good Hope,
affirms, that they equally plunge themselves
into the sea and rivers, and which is asserted by
other authors. Although Kolbe appears to be
more exact than common in his description of
the hippopotamus, yet it is doubtful whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
he saw it so often as he says, since the figure
he has joined to his description is worse than
those of Columna, Aldrovandus, and Prosper
Alpinus, which are all drawn from stuffed
skins. It is easy to discover that the figures
and description in Kolbe&rsquo;s works, have neither
been made on the spot, nor taken from Nature.
His descriptions are written from memory,
and most of the figures been copied from
those of other naturalists; the figure which he
gives of the hippopotamus, in particular, bears
a great resemblance to the cheropotamus of
Prosper Alpinus.</p>

<p>Kolbe, therefore, in affirming, that the
hippopotamus lives in the sea, might possibly
have copied Pliny, and not spoken from his
own observations. Most other authors tell us,
that this animal is only to be found in the fresh
water lakes and in rivers, sometimes at their
mouths, but oftener at a great distance from
the sea. There are even travellers, who, like
Merollo, are surprised, that the hippopotamus
should have been called the sea-horse, because,
say they, this animal cannot bear salt water.
He commonly remains all day under water,
and only quits it at night to graze upon land.
The male and female rarely separate. Zerenghi
caught both male and female the same day, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the same ditch. Dutch travellers say, that
they bring forth three or four young at a time,
but this fact appears to me very suspicious
from the evidence which Zerenghi has mentioned.
Besides, as the hippopotamus is of an
enormous bulk, he is in the class of the elephant,
rhinoceros, whale, and all other large
animals, who bring forth but one at a time;
and this analogy appears to me more certain
than all the suppositious testimonies of different
travellers.</p>

<p>I have been informed by Mr. Bruce
that in his travels through Africa he frequently
saw hippopotami in Lake Tzana, in Upper
Abyssinia, near the sources of the Nile; that
in this lake these animals are more numerous
than in any other part of the world, and that
he saw some which were at least twenty feet in
length.</p>

<p>Dr. Klockner, in his translation of the present
work, printed at Amsterdam, says, he is surprised
that M. de Buffon should have taken no
notice of a passage in Diodorus Siculus, respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the hippopotamus, in which that author
observes, &ldquo;that among the various animals
produced by the Nile, the crocodile and hippopotamus
deserve the most particular attention;
the latter is five cubits long; he has cloven
feet like ruminating animals, and in each
of his jaws he has three large tusks, somewhat
like those of a wild boar; while the prodigious
size of his body resembles that of an elephant.
His skin is exceedingly hard and strong, possibly
more so than that of any other animal. He is
amphibious, and remains as perfectly at ease
under water as upon land; he, however, comes
on shore in the night to seek pasture, and if the
species were numerous, they would prove very
destructive to the cultivated lands of Egypt.
To hunt this animal a number of men assemble,
and going in several boats attack him; when
once fastened to a rope, they leave him till he is
exhausted with plunging and the loss of blood:
his flesh is hard, and not good for digestion.&rdquo;
Dr. Klockner has also given an account of the
manner in which the skin was prepared of the
one sent from the Cape of Good Hope, and is
now in the Prince of Orange&rsquo;s cabinet, the dimensions
of which corresponded very nearly
with those of Zerenghi&rsquo;s. He likewise adds,
that he was informed by the nephew of Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Marias, a peasant of French extraction, who
shot this hippopotamus, and from whom he
had the relation, that the animal had wandered
a considerable way upon land, almost to a
place called the Mountains of Snow; this
Marias asserted that the hippopotamus runs
very swift upon land, and for which reason
these peasants, though good hunters, never attempted
to attack him but when he was in the
water; that it was the practice to watch for
him about sun-set, at which time he raises his
head above water, and perceiving any object
of prey, darts upon it with surprising quickness;
during his thus floating on the surface,
he keeps his ears in perpetual motion, constantly
listening if any noise is near, and while
in this position the hunters endeavour to shoot
him in the head; when wounded he plunges
under the water and traverses about as long
as life remains, and then floats to the top;
some of the party swim to him, and being fastened
by ropes he is dragged on shore by oxen,
where he is immediately dissected. A full
grown hippopotamus generally yields about
2000 lbs. weight of fat, which is salted and
sent to the Cape, where it is much esteemed
and sells very dear. By compression a mild
oil is drawn from it, which in Africa is considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as a certain remedy for diseases in the
breast.</p>

<p>In our preceding description of this animal
we remarked, that it was probable the hippopotamus
was so called from his voice having a
resemblance to the neighing of a horse, but
from many authentic accounts, we understand
that it comes nearer to the cry of the elephant,
or the indistinct stammerings of persons who
are deaf. When asleep he also makes a
snorting noise by which his retreat is discovered
at a distance; and of this he seems aware,
as he generally lies among reeds upon marshy
grounds, and where it is very difficult to come
near him.</p>

<p>I cannot consider the remark of Marias, relative
to the speed of this animal, as correct;
since so far from its being corroborated, all
others affirm that the hunters rather attack him
on land than in the water, which is a proof they
are not afraid of his swiftness; nay, some affirm
that it is customary to impede his return
by trees and ditches, from his constantly endeavouring
to regain the water, where he has
no enemy to apprehend, as both crocodiles
and sharks carefully avoid him.</p>

<p>As we before observed, his skin is so extremely
hard on his back, &amp;c. that neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
arrows nor musket balls can pierce it, but it is
thinner on the belly and insides of the thighs,
at which parts therefore the hunters constantly
aim. They sometimes endeavour to break his
leg with large blunderbusses, and if they succeed
in that their conquest is certain. The negroes
who do not hesitate to attack the sharks
and crocodiles, commonly avoid the hippopotamus,
and would probably never dare to
encounter him, but from a presumption that
if they fail he cannot overtake them; those of
Angola, Congo, Elmina, and the western coasts
of Africa, consider him as an inferior deity,
but yet they feel no repugnance in devouring
his flesh when they can procure it with safety.</p>

<p>The female brings forth among the rushes
upon land, but she soon teaches her young to
take refuge in the water, and which they do on
the smallest alarm. P. Labat asserts, that this
animal has sufficient intelligence to let himself
blood when he feels a necessity, and that he
performs the operation by rubbing a particular
part of his skin against a sharp-pointed rock,
and that when he thinks he has bled enough he
rolls himself in the mud until he has stopped
the wound; and it has also been affirmed that
the Indian painters make use of his blood as
one of their colours.</p>

<p>Although the Elk (<a href="#FIG_149"><i>fig. 149.</i></a>) and the
Rein-deer (<a href="#FIG_150"><i>fig. 150.</i></a>) are animals of different
species, we shall treat of them together, because
it is scarcely possible to write the history
of the one without borrowing a great deal
from the other. The greatest part of ancient,
and even modern authors, have confounded
them, or described them by equivocal denominations
which might be applied to both. The
Greeks had no knowledge either of the elk or
the rein-deer, for Aristotle makes no mention
of them; and, among the Latins, Julius CÃ¦sar
is the first who has made use of the word <i>Alce</i>.
Pausanias, who wrote above a hundred years
after Julius CÃ¦sar, is also the first Greek
author who takes notice of this name of
[Greek: AlchÃª]; and Pliny, who was nearly contemporary
with Pausanias, has very obscurely indicated
the elk and the rein-deer under the
names <i>alce</i>, <i>machlis</i>, and <i>tarandus</i>. We cannot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
therefore, say, that the name <i>alce</i>, is properly
Greek or Latin; it seems to have been
derived from the Celtic tongue, in which the
elk is named <i>elch</i> or <i>elk</i>. The Latin name of
the rein-deer is still more uncertain; many
naturalists have thought that this was the
<i>machlis</i> of Pliny, because this author, in speaking
of the animals of the north, quotes, at
the same time, the <i>alce</i> and the <i>machlis</i>, and
says that the last particularly belongs to Scandinavia,
and was never seen at Rome, nor even
in all the extent of the Roman empire. Nevertheless,
we find in CÃ¦sar&rsquo;s Commentaries a
passage that we can scarcely apply to any other
animal than the rein-deer, and which seems to
prove, that he existed at that time in the forests
of Germany; and fifteen centuries after
Julius CÃ¦sar, Gaston Ph&oelig;bus seems to speak
of the rein-deer under the name of the <i>rangier</i>,
as an animal which existed in his time in our
forests of France: he even gives a tolerable
description of this animal<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>, and of the method
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of taking and hunting him. As his description
cannot be applied to the elk, and as he gives, at
the same time, the manner of hunting the stag,
the fallow-deer, the wild goat, the chamois
goat, &amp;c. it cannot be supposed, that under
the article of the <i>rangier</i> he intended to speak
of any of those animals, or that he was deceived
in the application of the name.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_Q_17" id="Footnote_Q_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Q_17"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> The Rangier is very much like the stag, but has considerably
larger horns: when he is very much pressed in the
chace he puts his hind parts against a tree, and bends his
head to the ground, in which situation he is perfectly secure,
as his horns completely defend his whole body, and the
dogs are afraid to approach him. He is not higher than the
fallow-deer, but more bulky; he is hunted with dogs, but he
is more commonly shot with arrows, or taken in snares.
He feeds in the same manner as the stag and fallow-deer, and
lives to a great age. <i>La Venerie de Jacques Dufouilloux.</i></p></div>

<p>It appears, then, from these positive testimonies,
that the rein-deer formerly existed in
France, at least in the mountainous parts, such
as the Pyrennees, near which Gaston Ph&oelig;bus
dwelt as lord of the county of Foix, and that
since his time they had been destroyed like the
stags, who were heretofore common in this
country. It is certain that the rein-deer is
now to be found only in the most northern
countries; but we also know, that the climate
of France was formerly much more damp
and cold, occasioned by the number of woods
and morasses, which have since been cut down
and drained. By the letter of the Emperor
Julian, we learn what was the rigour of cold
at Paris in his time: the description he gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the ice on the Seine perfectly resembles what
the Canadians say of the ice on the rivers of
Quebec. Gaul, under the same latitude as
Canada, was, two thousand years ago, what
Canada is at present; that is to say, a climate
cold enough for these animals to live in, which
are now only to be met with in the regions of
the north.</p>

<p>By comparing and combining the above
testimonies, it appears to me, that the forests
of Gaul and Germany were stocked with elks
and rein-deer, and that the passages in CÃ¦sar&rsquo;s
Commentaries, can only be applied to those
two animals. As the land was cultivated, and
the waters became gradually dried up, the
temperature of the climate became more mild,
and those animals, who delight in cold, immediately
abandoned the flat countries, and retired
into the snowy region, where they lived
in the time of Gaston de Foix; and if they are
no longer to be found there, it is because this
temperature has been ever since increasing
in heat by the almost entire destruction of the
forests, by the successive lowering of the mountains,
the diminution of the waters, the multiplication
of mankind, and by the continual
increase of culture, and every other improvement.
I am likewise of opinion that Pliny
has borrowed from CÃ¦sar almost all he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
written of these two animals, and that he was
the first author of the confusion in their names.
He mentions at the same time the <i>alce</i> and the
<i>machlis</i>, from which we ought naturally to conclude,
that these two names mean two different
animals: however, if we remark, 1. That
he only simply names the alce without any
description whatever. 2. That he alone has
used the name <i>machlis</i>, which word is not to
be found in either Greek or Latin, but appears
to be coined, and which, according to
Pliny&rsquo;s commentators, is changed into that of
<i>alce</i> in many ancient manuscripts. 3. That
he attributes to the machlis all what Julius
CÃ¦sar gives to the alce; we cannot doubt
but the passage in Pliny is corrupted, and
that these two names mean the same animal,
namely, the elk. This question once decided
will also decide another. The <i>machlis</i> being
the <i>elk</i>, the <i>tarandus</i> must be the <i>rein-deer</i>.
This name of <i>tarandus</i> is not to be found in
any author before Pliny, and in the interpretation
of which, authors have greatly varied;
however, Agricola and Elliot have not hesitated
to apply it to the rein-deer; and for
the reasons just deduced, we subscribe to their
opinion. Besides, we must not be surprised
at the silence of the Greeks on the subject of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
these two animals, nor at the ambiguity with
which the Latins have spoken of them, since
the northern climates were absolutely strangers
to the first, and only known to the second
by relation.</p>

<p>The elk is only found on this, and the rein-deer
on the other, side of the polar circle in
Europe and in Asia. We find them in America,
in the lower latitudes, because the cold
is greater there than in Europe. The rein-deer
can bear the most excessive cold; he is
found in Spitsbergen; he is common in Greenland,
and in the most northern parts of Lapland
and Asia. The elk does not approach
so near the pole; he inhabits Norway, Sweden,
Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and all the
provinces of Siberia and Tartary, even to the
north of China. We meet with him under the
name of <i>Orignal</i>, and the rein-deer under that
of <i>Caribou</i> in Canada, and in all the northern
parts of America. Those naturalists, who
doubted whether the Orignal was the elk,
and the Caribou the rein-deer, had not compared
Nature with the testimonies of travellers.
These are certainly the same animals, though
like all the rest in the New Continent smaller
than those in the Old.</p>

<p>We may form a more perfect idea of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
elk and rein-deer, by comparing them with the
stag; the elk is taller, thicker, and stands more
erect upon his legs; his neck is shorter, his
hair longer, and his antlers wider and heavier
than those of the stag. The rein-deer is shorter,
his legs are smaller and thicker, and his feet
much larger; his hair is very thickly furnished,
and his horns much longer and divided
into a great number of branches, with flat
terminations; while those of the elk appear
to have been cut or broached at the edges.
Both have long hair under the neck, short tails,
and ears much longer than those of the stag;
they do not leap nor bound like the roe-buck,
but their pace is a kind of trot, so easy and
quick, that they go over almost as much ground
in the same time, without being in the least
fatigued; for they will sometimes continue
their trot for two days together, without resting.
The rein-deer lives upon the mountains;
and the elk dwells in low lands and damp forests;
both go in herds like the stags, and both
can be tamed, but the rein-deer with greater
ease than the elk. The last, like the stag,
has never lost his liberty, while the rein-deer
has been rendered domestic by the most unenlightened
part of mankind. The Laplanders
have no other cattle. In this icy climate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which receives only the oblique rays of the
sun, where the night and the day comprehend
two seasons; where the snow covers the earth
from the beginning of autumn to the end of
spring, and where the verdure of the summer
consists in the bramble, juniper, and moss,
where could man expect to procure necessary
nourishment for cattle? The horse, the ox, the
sheep, and all the other useful animals, could
not find subsistence there, nor resist the rigour
of the cold; it was therefore necessary to
search among the inhabitants of the forest for
the least wild and profitable animals; the Laplanders
have done what we should be obliged
to do ourselves if we were to lose our cattle;
we should then be forced to tame the stags,
and the roe-bucks of our forests to supply their
place; this I am persuaded, we should easily
accomplish, and soon derive as much advantage
from them as the Laplanders do from their
rein-deer. This example ought to make us sensible
how far Nature has extended her liberality
towards us; we do not make use of one half
her treasure, for her bounty is more immeasurable
than we can imagine; she has bestowed
on us the horse, the ox, the sheep,
and all other domestic animals, to serve, to
feed, and clothe us; and she has other species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in reserve, which would ably supply the deficiency,
and which only require us to subdue,
and make them useful to our wants. Man is
not acquainted with the powers of Nature, nor
how far her productions are to be improved by
the exertions of his capacity; instead of exploring
her unknown treasures, he is constantly
abusing those with which he is acquainted.</p>

<p>By comparing the advantages which the
Laplanders derive from the rein-deer with
those we experience from the domestic animals,
we shall see that he is worth two or
three of them. He is used as a horse to draw
sledges and carriages; he travels with great
speed and swiftness, travelling thirty leagues
a day with ease, and runs with as much certainty
on frozen snows as upon the mossy
down. The female affords milk more substantial
and nourishing than that of the cow.
The flesh is excellent food. His hair makes
an exceeding good fur, and his hide makes a
very supple and durable leather. Thus the
rein-deer alone affords all that we derive from
the horse, the ox, and the sheep.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Laplanders rear
and train these animals deserves our particular
attention. Olaus, SchÃ¦ffer, and Regnard, have
given interesting details on this subject, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which the following is an abstract: The horns
of the rein-deer, say these authors, are larger
and divided into a greater number of branches
than those of the stag. The food of this animal,
in the winter season, is a white moss,
which he finds under the deepest snow, and
which he ploughs up with his horns, or digs
up with his feet. In summer he lives upon the
buds and leaves of trees in preference to herbs,
which his forward spreading horns will not
permit him to brouze on with facility. He
runs upon the snow and sinks but little, by
reason of his broad feet. These animals are
very mild, and are kept in herds, which turn
out greatly to the profit of their owners; the
milk, hide, sinews, bones, hoofs, horns, hair,
and the flesh, are all useful and good. The
richest Laplanders have herds of four or five
hundred, and the poorest have ten or twelve.
They are led out to pasture, and shut up in
inclosures during the night, to shelter them
from the outrages of the wolves. If taken to
another climate they die in a short time.
Many centuries since, Steno, prince of Sweden,
sent six to Frederic, duke of Holstein;
and more recently, in 1533, Gustavus, king
of Sweden, sent ten over to Prussia, both
males and females; but they all perished, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
producing either in a domestic or free
state. &ldquo;I would fain (says M. Regnard)
have brought some rein-deer alive into France;
many persons have in vain attempted it, and
last year three or four were conducted to Dantzic,
where they soon died, not being able to
bear the heat of that climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are both wild and tame rein-deer in
Lapland. In the rutting season the females
are let loose to seek the wild males in the
woods; and as these wild males are more robust,
and stronger than the domestic ones,
the breed from this mixture are preferred for
harness. These rein-deer are not so gentle as
the others, for they not only sometimes refuse
to obey those who guide them, but often turn
and furiously attack them with their feet, so
that they have no other resource than to cover
themselves with the sledge until the fury of
the beast is subsided. This sledge is so light
that the Laplander can with ease turn it over
himself; the bottom of it is covered with the
skins of young rein-deers, the hair of which
is turned backwards, so that the sledge glides
easily forwards, and is prevented from recoiling
on the mountains. The harness of the
rein-deer is only a collar made of the skin,
with the hairs remaining on it, from whence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a trace is brought under the belly, between
the legs, and fastened to the fore part of the
sledge. The Laplander has only a single
cord, as a rein, fastened to the animal&rsquo;s horn,
which he throws sometimes on one side and
sometimes on the other of the beast, according
as he would direct him to the right or left.
They can travel four or five leagues an hour;
but the quicker he goes the more inconvenient
is the motion, and a person must be well accustomed,
and travel often, to be able to sit in
the sledge, and prevent it from turning over.</p>

<p>The rein-deer have outwardly many things
in common with the stag, and the formation
of their interior parts is nearly the same.
From this conformity of Nature, analogous
customs and similar effects result. The rein-deer
sheds his horns every year like the stag,
and, like him, makes very good venison.
The rutting season of both is towards the
end of September. The females of both
species go eight months with young, and
produce but one at a birth. The males
have the same disgustful smell in their rutting
time; and among the female rein-deer
there are also found some who are barren.
The young rein-deer, like the young fawns
of the stag, are variously coloured; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at first of a reddish colour, and becomes, as
they grow old, almost of an entire brown.
The young follow their mothers two or three
years, and they do not attain their full growth
till the age of four; it is at this age that they
begin to dress and exercise them for labour.
In order to render them more manageable they
are castrated when young, which operation the
Laplanders perform with their teeth. The
uncastrated males are very difficult to manage,
and they therefore make use only of those which
are gelded, among which they choose the most
lively and nimble to draw their sledges, and
the more heavy to carry their provisions and
baggage. They keep only one stallion rein-deer
for five or six females. These animals
are troubled with an insect, called the gad-fly,
who burrowing under their skins deposit their
eggs, so that sometimes by the end of winter
the worms that proceed from them render
their skins as full of holes as a sieve.</p>

<p>The herds of rein-deer require a great deal
of care; they are subject to elope, and voluntarily
strive to regain their natural liberty:
they must be closely attended, and narrowly
watched, and never led to pasture but in open
places; and in case the herd is numerous they
have need of many persons to keep them together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and to run after those which attempt
to stray. They are all marked, that they may
be known again, for it often happens that they
stray in the woods, or mix with other herds.
In short, the Laplanders are continually occupied
in the care of their rein-deer, which constitute
all their wealth, and they know well
how to procure every convenience, or, more
properly, all the necessities of life, from these
animals. In the winter season they cloath
themselves from head to foot with the furs of
the rein-deer, which are impenetrable to frost
or rain; and in summer they make use of the
hides from which the fur has fallen off. They
also spin the hair, and cover the sinews which
they take from the body of the dead animal,
for cordage and thread. They eat the flesh,
drink the milk, and of the latter they also
make very rich cheese. This milk, when
churned, gives, instead of butter, a kind of
suet. This particularly, as well as the largeness
of the horns, and the plenty of fat he
affords at the beginning of the rutting season,
are so many proofs of the superabundance of
nourishment; and what still more strongly
proves his superabundance to be excessive, or
at least greater than any other species, is
that the rein-deer is the only animal where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the female has horns as well as the male, and
this last is the only one also who sheds his
horns and renews them even when castrated.
For in stags, fallow-deer, and roe-bucks, who
have undergone this operation, the horns of the
animal remain always in the same state they
were at the moment of castration. Thus the
rein-deer is, of all animals, that in which the superfluity
of nutritive matter is the most apparent,
and this, perhaps, is less owing to the nature
of the animal than to the quality of its food,
for the white moss, which is his only aliment
during the winter, is a <i>lichen</i>, whose substance
resembles that of the mushroom; it is very
nourishing, and is more loaded with organic
molecules, than the leaves or buds of trees, and
it is for this reason that the rein-deer has
larger horns, and affords more fat than the
stag; and that the females, and those that are
castrated, are not deprived of horns: it is
the cause also of the great variety that is found
in the size of the horns, and of the figure and
number of the branches, beyond what is possessed
by any other of the deer kind. The
males who had been neither hunted nor confined,
and who feed amply, and at pleasure,
on this substantial aliment, have prodigious
large horns, which extend backward as far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the crupper, and forwards beyond the muzzle.
Those which are gelded have smaller horns,
yet much larger than the stag, and those of the
females are still less. Thus the horns of the
rein-deer, differ not only, like others, according
to age, but also according to sex and castration.
The horns, therefore, are so exceedingly
different in individuals, that it is not to be
wondered at that authors have differed so
much upon this subject.</p>

<p>Another singularity, which is common to
the rein-deer and the elk, we must not omit.
When these animals run, their hoofs at every
step make a crackling noise, as if all their
limbs were disjointed; and it is this noise, or
perhaps the scent, which informs the wolves of
their approach, who way-lay them, and if the
wolves are many in number, they will attack
and kill him; for the rein-deer is able to defend
himself against a single wolf, not, as may be
imagined, with his horns, for they are rather
of disservice than of use, but with his fore-feet,
which are very strong, and with which he
strikes the wolf with such force, as to stun, or
drive him away; after which he flies with such
speed as to be no longer in danger of being
overtaken. He has a more dangerous, though
a less numerous, and a less frequent enemy, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the <i>rosomack</i>, or <i>glutton</i>; this animal is more
voracious, but heavier than the wolf; he does
not pursue the rein-deer, but conceals himself
in a tree, and waits the arrival of his prey; as
soon as the rein-deer comes within his reach,
he darts upon him, fastens himself with his
nails upon his back, and tearing his head or
neck with his teeth, never quits his place till
he has killed him. He makes the like attacks,
and uses the stratagems to conquer the elk, who
is stronger than the rein-deer. This <i>rosomack</i>,
or <i>glutton</i> of the north, is the same animal as
the <i>carcajou</i> or <i>quincajou</i>, of North America;
his battles with the <i>orignal</i> are celebrated;
and, as we have formerly said, the <i>orignal</i> of
Canada is the same as the elk of Europe. It is
singular, that this animal, who is scarce bigger
than a badger, is able to conquer an elk,
whose size exceeds that of a horse, and whose
strength is so great, that with a single stroke of
his foot he can kill a wolf. But it is attested
by so many authorities, that we cannot have
the least doubt of its being the fact.</p>

<p>The elk and rein-deer are both ruminating
animals, as their method of feeding, and the
formation of their interior parts demonstrate;
nevertheless, TornÃ¦us Scheffer, Regnard,
Hulden, and others, have affirmed, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
rein-deer does not ruminate. Ray justly declares
this to be incredible; and, in fact, the
rein-deer does ruminate like every other animal
who has many stomachs. A domestic rein-deer
does not live more than fifteen or sixteen years,
but it must be presumed, that his life is of a
longer duration in a wild state; for this animal
being four years before he arrives at his
full growth, ought to live twenty-eight or
thirty years when in his natural state. The
Laplanders hunt the wild rein-deers by different
methods, according to the difference of seasons.
In the rutting season they make use of their
domestic females to attract the wild males.
They shoot them with the musket, or with the
bow, and they deliver their arrows with such
strength, that notwithstanding the thickness
of their hair and hide, they often kill one of
these beasts with a single arrow.</p>

<p>We have collected the facts in the history
of the rein-deer with the greater care and circumspection,
because we could not acquire
personal information on the subject, as it is
impossible to keep such an animal alive in
these parts. Having mentioned my regret
on this subject to some of my friends, Mr.
Colinson, Member of the Royal Society in
London, a gentleman as commendable for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
virtues, as for his literary merit, was so kind
as to send me over the skeleton of a rein-deer,
and I received from Canada the f&oelig;tus of a
caribou. By means of these two species, and
of several horns which were brought to me
from different places, I have been enabled to
verify the general resemblances, and the principal
differences between the rein-deer and the
stag.</p>

<p>With respect to the elk, I saw a living one
about fifteen years ago; but as he continued
only a few days in Paris, I had not time to
have a drawing finished; and that was the only
one by which I had an opportunity to verify
the description which the gentlemen of the
Academy of Sciences had formerly given of
this animal, and to assure myself that it was
exact, and perfectly conformable to Nature.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_R_18" id="Footnote_R_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_R_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> With respect to the figures of animals, we have in all
cases endeavoured to be more correct than the French edition,
by the addition of many original figures accurately
studied from the life, and whenever living subjects could
not be obtained, by comparing those drawings with preserved
figures in different cabinets, by which means we
have been enabled to remedy several defects; and in no one
more so than in our figure of the <i>Elk</i>.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;The elk (says the compiler of the Memoirs
of the Academy) is remarkable for the
length of his hair, the bigness of his ears, the
smallness of his tail, and the form of his eye,
the great angle of which is very wide, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
as the mouth, which is much larger than that
of oxen, stags, or other animals who have cloven
feet. The elk which we dissected was
nearly of the size of a stag. The length of
his body was five feet and a half, from the end
of the muzzle to the beginning of the tail,
which is only two inches long; as it was of a
female, the head had no horns; and the neck
was only nine inches long and nearly of the
same breadth. The ears were nine inches
long, and four wide. The colour of the hair
was not much unlike that of the ass, the grey
tinge of which sometimes approaches that of
the camel; but it differed in other respects, for it
was shorter, and from that of the camel, which
is much finer. The length of the hair was
three inches, and its thickness equalled that
of the largest mane of a horse; this thickness
gradually diminished towards the extremity
which was very pointed; towards the root it
also diminished, but, all of a sudden, grew
thicker again; and this end was of a different
colour from the rest of the hair, being white
and diaphanous, like the bristles of a hog.
The hair was as long as that of a bear, but
straighter, thicker, flatter, and all of the same
kind. The upper lip was large and loosened
from the gums, but not so large as Solinus has
described it, nor as Pliny has given to the animal
which he terms <i>machlis</i>.   These authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
say, that this beast is constrained to go backwards
when he is at pasture to prevent his lip
from entangling between his teeth. We observed
in the dissection, that Nature had provided
against this inconvenience by the size and
strength of the muscles, destined to elevate the
upper lip. We also found the articulations of
the leg very strongly bound together by ligaments,
whose firmness and thickness might
have given rise to the opinion that the <i>alce</i> was
not able to raise himself up when once he was
down. His feet were like those of the stag, having
no peculiarity except that of being larger.
We have observed, that the great angle of the
eye was slit downwards much more than in the
stag, fallow-deer, and roe-buck, but this slit
was not in the direction of the opening of the
eye, but made an angle with the line which
goes from one corner of the eye to the other;
the inferior lachrymal gland was an inch and a
half long. We found a part in the brain, which,
from its size, seemed to point out a connection
with that of the smell, which, according to
Pausanias, is more exquisite in the elk, than in
any other animal; for the olfactory nerves,
commonly called the <i>namillary nocesses</i>, were
without comparison larger than in any other
animal we ever dissected. As for the bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
flesh which some authors have placed upon
his back, and others under his chin, if they
have not been deceived, or have not been too
credulous, those things were peculiar to those
elks of which they have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We can add our own testimony to that of
the gentlemen of the Academy, for in the female
elk, which we saw alive, there was no
bunch either under the chin or on the neck;
nevertheless, LinnÃ¦us, who ought to be acquainted
with elks better than we can pretend
to be, as he lives in the same country, makes
mention of this bunch, and has even given it as
an essential character of the elk: <i>Alces cervus
cornibus a caulibus palmatis caruncula gutturali</i>.
LinnÃ¦us, Syst. Nat. Edit. X. p. 66.&mdash;There
is no other method of reconciling
this assertion of LinnÃ¦us, with our negation,
than by supposing this bunch, or <i>guttural caruncula</i>,
to belong to the male elk which we
have not seen. But if that be the case, this
author should not have made it an essential
character of the species, since the female has
it not; perhaps also, this bunch is only a common
disorder among the elks, a kind of wen;
for in the two figures of this animal, given by
Gesner, the first, who has no horns, has a
thick caruncula under the neck; and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
second, which represents a male elk with
horns, there is no caruncula.</p>

<p>In general the elk is much larger and
stronger than the stag or rein-deer. His hair
is so rough, and his hide so hard, that a musket
ball can scarcely penetrate it. His legs are
very firm, with so much agility and strength,
especially in the fore feet, that he can kill a
man or a wolf, and even break a tree by one
single stroke with his foot. Nevertheless, he
is hunted nearly as we hunt the stag, with
men and dogs. It is affirmed, that when he
is pursued he often falls down all at once,
without being either shot or wounded. From
this circumstance some have presumed that
this animal was subject to the epilepsy, and on
this presumption (which is not well founded,
since fear alone might produce the same effect)
this absurd conclusion has been drawn, that
his hoof is a remedy for the epilepsy, and even
a preventative against it; and this ridiculous
opinion has been so universally dispersed,
that many people still wear rings, the collet of
which incloses a small piece of the hoof of an
elk.</p>

<p>As there are but few people in the northern
parts of America, all animals, and particularly
elks, are in greater numbers there than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
north of Europe. The savages are not ignorant
of the art of hunting and taking the elks;
they follow them by the track of their feet,
and very often for many days together, and by
address and perseverance they often gain their
end. Their method of hunting them in winter
is particularly singular. &ldquo;They make use
of rackets (says Denys), by means of which
they walk on the snow without sinking. The
<i>orignal</i> does not get forward very fast, because
his sinking in the snow greatly fatigues him.
He eats nothing but the young shoots of the
trees, therefore, where the savages find the
trees eaten, they presently meet with the animals,
which are never far off, and which they
approach very easily. They throw darts at
them, which are large clubs, having at the
end a large pointed bone, which pierces like a
sword. If there be many orignals in one troop
the savages put them to flight, for then the
orignals, placing themselves in a rank, describe
a large circle, sometimes more than two leagues,
and which, by frequently traversing, they
harden so much with their feet that they no
longer sink in. The savages wait for and kill
them as they pass, with their darts.&rdquo; In comparing
this relation with those we have already
quoted, we find, that the savage and the <i>orignal</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of America, are exact copies of the Laplander
and elk of Europe.</p>

<p>M. Allemand, in his edition, has added
some remarks respecting the elk and rein-deer,
and, among them, says, that M. de Buffon
appears to be warranted in the opinion
that the elk of Europe is the orignal of North
America, and that the only difference between
them is in the size; but that most travellers
differ from M. de Buffon&rsquo;s general conclusion,
that the latter is the largest. Mr. Dudley, in
particular, has described an <i>orignal</i> to the
Royal Society, which had been killed by some
hunters, that was more than ten feet high; a
stature requisite to carry the horns which La
Hontan has affirmed to weigh from three to
four hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond had a female orignal
in his park, in the year 1766, which he received
as a present from General Carleton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
then governor of Canada; it was not more
than a twelvemonth old, and was about five
feet in height; its back and thighs were of a
deep brown, and the belly much lighter; but
this animal did not live more than nine or ten
months. M. Allemand says, that he received
the head of a female orignal from Canada,
which was much larger, as it measured, from
the end of the muzzle to the ears, two feet
three inches, was two feet eight inches round
at the ears, and one foot ten inches near the
mouth, and its ears were nine inches long;
this head being dried was consequently less in
its dimensions than when the animal was alive.</p>

<p>In the same manner this gentleman considers
M. de Buffon&rsquo;s opinion, that the caribou
of America is the same animal as the rein-deer
of Lapland, and he is induced so to do by comparing
the drawing of the rein-deer (taken
from life by Ridinger) with that of the drawing
of an American caribou, sent him by the
Duke of Richmond, who had kept one of
those animals a considerable time in his park.</p>

<p>To the remarks already given concerning
the rein-deer, there is little to add, yet the opportunity
must be embraced of giving the
figure (<a href="#FIG_150"><i>fig. 150.</i></a>) of a female, drawn from
life while in the possession of the Prince of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
CondÃ©; he received it from the King of Sweden,
who also sent him two males, one of
which died on his way, and the other almost
as soon as he arrived in France. This animal
was about the size of a hind, though her legs
were somewhat shorter, and in her body she
was more bulky. She had also horns like the
male, but shorter, and which were separated
into antlers, some of them pointing forwards,
and others bent backwards. M. de SevÃ©
gave me a very particular description of this
animal; he said, the length of the body, from
the muzzle to the crupper, was five feet one
inch; the height of the withers, two feet eleven
inches, and nine lines more at the crupper;
the hair was very close, about an inch
long on the body, longer on the belly, and
very short on the legs; upon the body it was
a reddish brown, intermixed in some places
with a yellowish white, being of a deeper colour
on part of the back, on the thighs, on
the top of the head, and on the eye-pits;
round the eyes and nostrils were black; the
point of the muzzle white; the ears, over
which the hair was thick, a yellowish white
mixed with brown, the inside of them had
long white hairs; the neck, and the long
hairs below the breast, and upon the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
part of the back, were of a yellowish white;
the legs and thighs were of a deep brown,
and of a greyish white on the insides, of
which colour were also the hairs which covered
the hoofs; the feet were cloven; the
two fore toes being broader than the hind
ones; they were all very thin, and extremely
black.</p>

<p>No conclusion must be drawn as to the size
of the rein-deer&rsquo;s horns from the figure we
have given, as some of them have horns so enormous
as to reach back to their cruppers, at the
same time branching out above a foot in the
front. There can be little doubt but the large
fossil horns found in Ireland have belonged
to a species of the rein-deer, and of which
Mr. Collinson informed me that he had seen
some which had an interval of ten feet between
their extremities; it must be to this species
and not to the elk which the fossil bones of the
animal, called mouse-deer, must be attributed.
But it must be admitted, that there do not at
present exist any rein-deer of sufficient size
and strength to carry horns of that magnitude
as are found in a fossil state in Ireland, in many
parts of Europe, and even in North America.
I have lately been informed there are two kinds
of the rein-deer, the one considerably larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
than the other, of which I was not acquainted
when I gave my former description; the one I
referred to, and compared to the caribou of
America, and the Greenland fallow-deer, was
of the small sort.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by some travellers, that
the rein-deer is the fallow-deer of the north;
while Pontoppidan says the rein-deer is not able
to exist but in the northern regions, and even
there they are obliged to dwell on the tops of
the highest mountains; this author also asserts
that their horns are moveable, that they
can turn them about at pleasure, and that over
the eyelids they have an opening in the skin,
through which they see, when the glare of the
snow prevents them from opening their eyes.</p>

<p>Upon almost the slightest motion these animals
make a crackling noise; when running,
touched, or even surprised, this noise is heard.
I have been informed it is the same with the
elk but I cannot ascertain it as the fact.</p>

<p>Although it appears that the Greeks
were acquainted with the wild and chamois
goats yet they have not described them by any
particular denomination, nor even by characters
sufficiently exact by which to distinguish
them; they have only mentioned them under
the general name of <i>Wild Goats</i>. They probably
presumed, that these animals were of the
same species as the domestic goats, never having
given them proper names, as they have done to
every other species of quadrupeds. On the contrary,
our modern naturalists have regarded
the wild and chamois goats as two real and
distinct species, and both different from that
of the common goat. There are facts and
reasons for and against both opinions, of which
we shall give a detail, and wait until it be
ascertained whether they intermix together
and produce fertile individuals, experience
having taught us, that this is the sole criterion
on which can the question be decided.</p>

<p>The male wild goat differs from the chamois,
by the length, thickness, and form of
his horns; he is also more bulky, vigorous, and
stronger. The female wild goat has smaller
horns than the male, and nearly resembling
those of the chamois. In other respects, these
two animals have the same customs, the same
manners, and inhabit the same climate; only
the wild goat being more agile, and stronger,
climbs to the summits of the highest mountains,
while the chamois never goes higher
than the second stage; but neither of them are
to be found in the plains; both clear their way
in the snow, and both bound from one rock
to another. Both are covered with a firm
solid skin, and cloathed in winter with a double
fur, with very rough hair outwardly, and a
more fine and thicker underneath. Both of
them have a black stripe on the back, and
tails nearly of the same size. The number of
exterior resemblances in fact is so great, and
the conformity of the exterior parts is so complete,
that we might be led to believe these
two animals were only simple varieties of the
same species. The wild, as well as the chamois
goats when taken young, and brought up with
domestic goats, are easily tamed, imbibe the
same manners, herd together, return to the same
fold, and probably, copulate and produce together.
But this last fact, the most important
of all, and which alone would decide the question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is not ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> We have never
learnt for a certainty whether the wild and the
chamois copulate with our goats; we only
suppose it, and in this respect agree with the
ancients. But our presumption appears
founded upon those analogies which experience
has seldom contradicted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_S_19" id="Footnote_S_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_S_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Sonnini has an important fact upon this subject. He
says that M. Berthoud van Berchem saw mongrels which
proceeded from the copulation of a wild goat brought up
at Aigle in the Lower Vallais, in the house of the governor
of Vatteville, with many domestic goats. All the inhabitants
of the town of Aigle were witnesses of this fact.</p></div>

<p>Let us, nevertheless, take a view of the reasons
against it. The wild and chamois goats
both subsist in a state of nature, and both are
constantly distinct. The chamois sometimes
comes of his own accord and joins the flock
of our domestic kind, but the wild goat never
associates with them, at least before he is
tamed. The male wild goat and the common
he-goat have very long beards and the chamois
has none. The male and female chamois
have very small horns: those of the male
wild goat are so thick and so long, that they
would scarcely be imagined to belong to an
animal of his size. The chamois also appears
to differ from the wild goat and the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he-goat, by the direction of his horns, which
are inclined a little forwards in their lower parts,
and bent backwards at the point in the form
of a hook; but, as we have already remarked,
in speaking of oxen and sheep, the horns of
domestic animals vary prodigiously, as do also
those of wild animals, according to the differences
of climate. Our female goats have
not their horns absolutely resembling those of
the male. The horns of the male wild goat
are not very different from those of our he-goat;
and as the female wild goat approaches
the domestic kind, and even the chamois, in
size and smallness of the horns, may we not
conclude, that the wild, the chamois, and the
domestic goat, are, in fact, but one species, in
which the nature of the females is invariably
alike, while the males are subject to variations?
In this point of view, which, perhaps,
is not so distinct from Nature as might be
imagined, the wild goat would be the male in
the original race of goats, and the chamois
the female. This is not imaginary, since we
can prove by experience, that there are in
Nature, animals where the females will equally
serve the males of different species, and produce
young from both. The sheep produces
with the he-goat as well as with the ram, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
always brings forth lambs of its own species;
the ram, on the contrary, does not copulate
with the she-goat. We may, therefore, look
upon the sheep as a female common to two
different males, and consequently, constitutes
a species independent of the male. It may
be the same in that of the wild goat; the female
alone represents the primitive species,
because her nature is constant; the males, on
the contrary, vary, and there is a great appearance
that the domestic she-goat, which
may be considered as the same female as the
chamois and the wild kind, would produce
with these three different males, which alone
make the variety in the species, and consequently
do not alter the identity, although they
appear to change the unity of it.</p>

<p>These, like most other possible accounts,
must be found in Nature; it even appears,
that the females in general contribute more to
the support of the species than the males; for
though both concur in the first formation of the
f&oelig;tus, the female, who afterwards alone furnishes
all that is necessary to its growth and
nutrition, modifies and assimilates it more to
her own nature, which cannot fail of effacing
the impression of the parts derived from the
male. Thus, if we would judge deliberately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and rationally of a species, the females should
be the objects examined. The male gives half
of the living substance, the female gives as
much, and furnishes besides all the necessary
matter for its formation. A handsome woman
has almost always fine children; a handsome
man with an ugly woman, commonly has
children who are still more ugly.</p>

<p>Thus, in the same species, there may sometimes
be two races, the one masculine, and the
other feminine, both of which subsisting and
perpetuating their distinctive characters, seem
to constitute two different species; and this is
the point where it appears almost impossible to
fix the term between what naturalists call <i>species</i>
and <i>variety</i>. Suppose, for example, we should
constantly couple he-goats with some sheep, and
rams with others; it is evident, that after a
certain number of generations, there would
be established in the species of the sheep, a
breed which would tend greatly towards the
goat, and would afterwards perpetuate itself;
for, though the first produce with the he-goat
would be very little removed from the species
of the mother, and would be a lamb and not a
kid, nevertheless this lamb would have hair,
and some other characteristics of its father. If
we afterwards couple the he-goat with these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
female bastards, the production of this second
generation will approach nearer to the species
of the father, still nearer in the third, and so
on. By this method the adventitious characters
would soon prevail over the natural
ones, and this fictitious breed might support
itself, and form a variety in the species, whose
origin it would be very difficult to recognize;
therefore what can be done by the influence of
the one species on another, may still be more
effectually produced by the same species. If
strong females have continually only weak
males, in course of time, a feminine race will
be established; and if very strong males are
put to females of inferior strength and vigour,
a masculine race will be the result, and will
appear so different from the first, as hardly to
be allowed to have one common origin, and
which consequently will be regarded as really
distinct and separate species.</p>

<p>To these general reflections, we shall add
some particular observations. LinnÃ¦us speaks
of two animals which he had seen in Holland,
that were of the goat kind; the horns of the first
were short, almost resting upon the skull, and
its hair was long; the second had erect horns,
the points turned back, and the hair short.
These animals, which appeared to be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in species than the chamois and the common
goat, nevertheless produced together, which
sufficiently demonstrates that these differences
in the shape of the horns, and length of the
hair, are not specific and essential characters;
for as these animals produced together, they
must be regarded as the same species. From
this example we may draw a very probable induction,
that the chamois and our goat, whose
principal differences consist in the shape of
the horns and the length of the hair, are probably
one and the same species.</p>

<p>In the royal cabinet there is a skeleton of
an animal which was given to the menagerie
under the name of <i>capricorne</i>; it perfectly resembles
the domestic goat in the make of the
body and the proportion of the bones, and in
the form of the lower jaw, that of the wild-goat;
but he differs from both in the horns; those of
the wild-goat have prominent tubercles, and two
longitudinal ridges; those of the common he-goat
have but one ridge, and no turbercles, the
horns of the capricorne have but one ridge
and no tubercles, but only rugosities which are
larger than those of the goat; these differences
indicate, therefore, an intermediate
race between the wild and the domestic goat.
The horns of the capricorne are also short and
crooked at the point, like those of the chamois,
and, at the same time, they are compressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and have rings; thus they partake at once of
the common goat, the wild goat, and the chamois
goat.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown, in his History of Jamaica, relates,
that in that island there is actually to be
found, 1. The common domestic goat of Europe;
2. The chamois; and 3. The wild goat.
He affirms, that neither of these three animals
are natives of America, but have been transported
from Europe; that they have, like the sheep,
degenerated and become smaller in this new
country; that the wool of the sheep is changed
into a rough hair like that of the goat; that
the wild goat appears to be a bastard race, &amp;c.
From this we are induced to suppose that the
small goat, with erect horns and crooked at the
points, which LinnÃ¦us saw in Holland, and
was said to come from America, is the chamois
of Jamaica, that is, the chamois of Europe degenerated,
and become less by the climate of
America; and that the wild goat of Jamaica,
which Mr. Brown calls the bastard wild goat,
is our capricorne, which appears to be only a
wild goat degenerated, and whose horns might
have varied by the influence of the climate.</p>

<p>M. Daubenton, after having scrupulously
examined the affinities of the chamois with
those of the he-goat and the ram, says, that in
general, it resembles more the first than the
last; the principal differences besides the horns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
are the form and size of the forehead, which
is less elevated and shorter in the chamois than
in the goat, and the form of the nose, which is
more contracted; so that in these two, the chamois
bears a greater resemblance to the ram
than to the goat. But supposing, for which
there is much reason, that the chamois is a constant
variety of the species of the he-goat, as
the bull-dog and greyhound are fixed varieties
in the species of the dog, we shall see that
these differences in the size of the forehead and
the position of the nose, are not nearly so great
in the chamois, relatively to the goat, as in
the bull-dog relative to the greyhound, which,
nevertheless produce together, and are certainly
of the same species. In other respects,
as the chamois resembles the goat by a greater
number of characters than the ram, if it
constitute a particular species, it must necessarily
be an intermediate one betwixt the
goat and the ram. We have observed, that
the he-goat and the sheep produce together,
therefore the chamois, which is an intermediate
species between the two, and at the
same time is much nearer the goat than the
ram, by the number of resemblances, ought to
copulate with the she-goat and consequently
must not be considered but as a variety constant
in this species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>As the chamois which was transported to
and became less in America, produces with
the small goat of Africa, there can be little
doubt but he would also produce with the
she-goats of the common kind. The chamois,
therefore, is only a constant variety in
the species of the goat, as the bull-dog is in
that of the dog; and, on the other hand, we
can scarcely question that the wild goat is
the primitive goat in the state of nature and,
is with respect to domestic goats, what the
muflon is to the sheep. The wild goat exactly
resembles the domestic he goat, in figure,
conformation, and in natural and physical
habits; it only varies by two slight differences
the one exterior, the other interior; the horns
of the wild goat are larger than those of the
common he-goat the former having two longitudinal
ridges, and the latter but one; they
have also large transverse rings which mark the
number of years of their growth, while those
of the common he-goats are only marked with
transverse strokes. The figure of their bodies
is in other respects perfectly alike. The
interior part is also similar, excepting the
spleen, which is oval in the wild goat, and
approaches nearer to that of the roe-buck, or
stag than that of the he-goat, or ram. This
last difference may proceed from the violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
exercise of this animal. The wild goat runs
as fast as the stag, and leaps lighter than the
roe-buck; the spleen, therefore, ought to be
made like that of the swiftest running animals.
This difference, then, is owing less to Nature
than to custom, and it is to be presumed, that
if our domestic he-goats were to become wild,
and were forced to run and to leap like the
wild goats, the spleen would soon assume the
form most convenient to this exercise. With
respect to his horns, the differences, though
very apparent, do not prevent their more resembling
those of the he-goat than of any other
animal. Thus the wild and common he-goat
approaching nearer to each other than to any
other animal, even in this part, which is the
most different of all, we must conclude, as
they are alike in every other particular, that,
notwithstanding this slight and single disagreement,
they both are animals of the same species.</p>

<p>I consider, therefore, the wild, the chamois,
and the domestic goat, as one species, in which
the males have undergone greater varieties than
the females; and I find, at the same time, secondary
varieties in the domestic kind, which
are less equivocal, as they belong equally to the
males and females. We have seen that the
goats of Angora, though very different from
ours, in the hair and horns, are, nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the same species. The same may be said
of the Juda goat, which LinnÃ¦us with much
reason has considered as a variety of the domestic
species. This goat, which is common
in Guinea, Angola, and other parts of Africa,
differs from ours only in being smaller, fatter,
and more squat; his flesh is also better, and
preferred in that country to mutton, as we
prefer the flesh of the sheep to that of the goat.
It is the same with the Levant, or Mambrina
goat,<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> with long hanging ears; which is only
a variety of the goat of Angora, who has also
hanging ears, but not so long. The ancients
were acquainted with these goats, but they
did not separate them from the common
species. The variety of the Mambrina goat
is more diffused than that of the goat of Angora;
for we find these very long-eared goats
in Egypt, and the East Indies, as well as in
Syria; they give plenty of good milk, and
which the eastern nations prefer to that of the
cow, or female buffalo.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> The name of Mambrina goat arises from this animal
being common on the mountain of Mambre or Mamre,
situated in the southern part of Palestine, near the environs
of Herbron. It is the only sort which is diffused over
Lower Egypt. It is said that its ears are so long that they
drag them on the ground, and that the Orientalists cut one
of them that the animal may feed: but this is an exaggeration
and an error; the ears do not trail upon the ground,
neither are they cut.</p></div>

<p>With respect to the small goat that Linnaeus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
saw alive, and which produced with the American
chamois, it must have, as we observed,
been originally transported from Africa; for
it so greatly resembles the African he-goat,
that we cannot doubt of its being of the same
species, or that it, at least, owes its first origin
to it. This goat is small in Africa, and would
become still less in America; and we know,
by the testimony of travellers, that it has for a
long time been as customary to transport from
Africa, as from Europe into America, sheep,
hogs, and goats, whose races still subsist without
any other alteration than a diminution in
the size.</p>

<p>After having examined the different varieties
of goats, and considered them relatively to
each other, it appears to me, that of the nine
or ten species of which the nomenclators speak,
there is, in reality, but one; for instance,
1. The wild he-goat is the principal stock of
the species. 2. The capricorne is the wild
goat degenerated by the influence of climate.
3. The domestic he-goat derives his origin
from the wild he-goat. 4. The chamois is
only a variety in the species of the she-goat,
with whom he would be able to produce as
well as the wild goat. 5. The small goat
with erect horns, crooked at the points, which
LinnÃ¦us speaks of, is the chamois of Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
become smaller in America. 6. The other
small goat with horns lying flat, and which
produced with the small chamois of America,
is the same as the he-goat of Africa, and the
production of these two animals prove, that
our chamois and domestic he-goat would also
produce together, and are, consequently, of the
same species. 7. The dwarf goat, which is
probably the female of the African buck, and,
like the male, only a variety of the common
kind. 8. It is the same with the bucks and
she-goats of Juda, they are only varieties of
our domestic goats. 9. The goat of Angora
is also of the same species, since it produces
with our goats. 10. The Membrina goat,
with large pendulous ears, is a variety in the
race of the goats of Angora. These ten animals,
therefore, are only ten different races of
one species, produced by the difference of climate.
<i>CaprÃ¦ in multos similitudines, transfigurantur</i>,
says Pliny; and in effect, we see
by this enumeration, that the goats, although
essentially like each other, yet vary much in
their external form; and if we should comprehend,
with Pliny, under the generic name of
Goats, not only all those we have mentioned
but also the roe-buck, the gazelle, the antelope,
&amp;c. this would be the most extended species in
Nature, and contains more kinds and varieties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
than that of the dog. But Pliny was not
sufficiently informed of the real differences of
species when he joined the roe-buck, antelope,
&amp;c. to the species of the goat. These animals,
though bearing much resemblance to the goat
in many respects, yet are different species; and
we shall see, from the following articles, how
much the antelopes vary, both in species and
races; and after enumerating all the goats and
all the antelopes we shall find many animals
still remain, which participate of both. In
the whole history of quadrupeds I find nothing
more difficult to explain, nor more confused or
uncertain, than the accounts given by travellers
of goats, antelopes, and other species which
have an affinity to them. I have exerted all
my endeavours, and employed all my attention,
to throw some light upon it, and shall
not regret my labour, if what I now write may
contribute to prevent errors, fix ideas, and
bring forth the truth, by extending the views
of those who would study Nature.&mdash;But to
our subject.</p>

<p>All goals are liable to vertigos; this disease
is also common to the wild and chamois goats,
as well as the inclination to climb up rocks,
and the custom of continually licking stones,
especially those which are impregnated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
nitre or salt. In the Alps are rocks which
have been hollowed by the tongues of the
chamois; these are commonly composed of
soft and calcinable stones, in which there is
always a certain quantity of nitre. These natural
agreements, these conformable customs,
appear to be sufficient indexes of the identity
of species. The Greeks, as we have said, did
not separate these into three different species;
and our hunters, who, probably, never consulted
the Greeks, have always looked upon
them as the same species. Gaston Ph&oelig;bus,
when speaking of the wild goat, particularises
him under the name of the wild buck; and
the chamois, which he calls <i>ysarus</i> and <i>sarris</i>,
is also, according to him, but another wild
goat. I own that all these authorities do not
make a complete proof, but by uniting them
with the facts and reasons we have produced,
they form such strong presumptions upon the
unity of the species of these three animals,
that we can harbour no doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>The wild and chamois goats, one of which
I look upon as the male, and the other as the
female stock of the goat kind, are only found,
like the muflon, who is the stock of the sheep,
in deserts, and in the most craggy and highest
mountains. The Alps, the Pyrennees, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mountains of Greece, and those in the islands
of the Archipelago, are almost the only places
where the wild and the chamois goats are to
be found. But although both dislike heat
and inhabit the regions of snow and ice, yet
they have also an aversion to excessive cold.
In summer, they chuse the north side of the
mountains; in winter they move to the
southern and even descend from the summits.
Neither can support themselves on their legs
upon the ice when it is smooth, but if there be
the least inequalities on its surface, they bound
along with security.</p>

<p>The chace of these animals is very laborious,
and dogs are almost useless in it. It is likewise
very dangerous, for the animal finding
himself hard pushed will turn and strike the
hunter with his head, and sometimes throw
him over a precipice. The chamois is as
swift, though not so strong, as the wild goats;
they are more numerous, and commonly go
in herds; they are not, however, so numerous
as they were formerly, at least in our Alpine
and Pyrenean mountains.</p>

<p>M. Peroud, surveyor of the chrystal mines
in the Alps, brought over a living chamois,
and gave the following excellent information
on the natural habits and manners of this animal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
&ldquo;The chamois is a wild animal, yet
very docile; he inhabits only rocks and mountains.
He is about the size of a domestic goat,
and resembles him in many respects. He is
most agreeably, lively, and active beyond expression.
His hair is short like that of the
doe; in spring it is of an ash-colour; in summer
rather yellow; in autumn a deep yellow
mixed with black, and in winter of a blackish
brown. The chamois are found in great
numbers in the mountains of Dauphiny, Piedmont,
Savoy, Switzerland, and Germany:
they live sociably together, and are found in
flocks of from eight to fifteen or twenty, and
sometimes they are seen to the number of
from sixty to a hundred dispersed in small
flocks upon the crags of a mountain. The
large males keep separate from the rest, except
in their rutting-time, when they approach the
females. During this time they have a very
strong smell; they bleat often and run from
one mountain to another. The time of their
coupling is from the beginning of October to
the end of November, and they bring forth in
March and April. The young female receives
the male at a year and a half old. The young
follow the dam for about five months, and
sometimes longer, if the hunters, or the wolves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
do not separate them. It is asserted that they
lire between twenty and thirty years. Their
flesh is very good, and some of the fattest
afford ten or twelve pounds of suet, which is
better and harder than that of the goat. The
blood of this animal is extremely hot, and is
said to approach very nearly to that of the wild
goat in its qualities and virtues, and may prove
of the same service, for the effects are the same
when taken in a double quantity: it is reckoned
very good against pleurisies, a great purifier
of the blood, and a restorative of perspiration.
The hunters very often mix the blood
of the wild and chamois goats together, and
sometimes they sell the blood of the wild
goat for that of the chamois. It is very difficult
to distinguish the one from the other,
which proves there can be but very little difference
in them. The cry of the chamois is
not distinct but faint, and resembling that of a
hoarse domestic goat: it is by this cry they
collect together, and by which the mother calls
her young. But when they are frightened, or
perceive an enemy, or any object which they
cannot distinguish, they warn the rest of the
flock by a kind of whistling noise. The
chamois has a very penetrating sight, and his
hearing and smell are not less discriminating.
When he sees a man near he stops for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
moment, and then flies off with the utmost
speed. When the wind is in its favour he can
smell a human creature for more than half a
mile distance; therefore when he hears or
scents any thing which he cannot see, he
begins to whistle or blow with such force that
the rocks and the forests re-echo the sound;
if others are within hearing they are all alarmed;
this whistling continues as long as the
breath will permit: in the beginning it is very
shrill, and deeper towards the close. The
animal then rests a moment, after the alarm,
to inspect farther into the danger, and having
confirmed his suspicion, he commences his
whistling, and continues it, by intervals, till
it has spread the alarm to a great distance.
During this time he is most violently agitated;
he strikes the ground with his feet; he bounds
from rock to rock; he turns and looks round;
leaps from one precipice to another; and when
he obtains a sight of his enemy he flies from
it with all speed. The whistling of the male
is more acute than that of the female: it is
performed through the nostrils, and is no
more than a very strong blowing, and resembles
the noise which a man would make by fixing
his tongue to the palate, keeping the teeth
nearly shut, the lips open, and a little lengthened,
and blowing with all his force. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
chamois feeds on the best herbage, and chuses
the most delicate part of plants, as the flowers
and most tender buds. He is not less fond of
several aromatic herbs, which grow upon the
side of the Alps. He drinks very little while
he feeds upon the succulent herbage. He
ruminates like the common goat. The food
he makes use of strongly marks the warmth of
his constitution, as do his large eyes, which are
admired for their roundness and sparkling, and
the vivacity of his disposition. His head is
crowned with two small horns, of about half a
foot long; they are of a beautiful black, and
rise from the forehead almost betwixt the eyes,
and, instead of bending backwards like other
animals, they jet forward above the eyes, and
bend backward at the extremities in a small
circle, and end in a very sharp point. His
ears are placed in a very elegant manner near
the horns, and there are stripes of black on
each side of the face, the rest being of a whitish
yellow, which never changes. The horns of
this animal are often made use of for the heads
of canes; those of the female are less, and not so
much bent; and some farriers make use of them
for bleeding cattle. The hides of these animals
are very strong, nervous, and supple, and
when dressed, excellent breeches, vests, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
gloves, are made of them; this sort of cloathing
is very durable, and of very great service
to labouring men. The chamois is a native
of cold countries, and generally prefers craggy
rocks and high places; they indeed frequent the
woods, but it is only those in the highest regions,
where the forests consist of firs, larch, and
beech trees. These animals have so much
dread of heat, that in summer they are only to be
found in the caverns of rocks amidst fragments
of congealed ice, or in forests where the high and
spreading trees form a shade for them, or under
rough and hanging precipices that face the
north, where the rays of the sun seldom disturbs
them. They go to pasture both morning and
evening, but seldom during the day. They
traverse over rocks with great facility, where
the dogs cannot follow them. There is nothing
more wonderful than to see them climbing and
descending precipices, inaccessible to all other
quadrupeds. They mount and descend always
in an oblique direction, and throw themselves
down a rock of twenty or thirty feet, and alight
with great security. In descending they strike the
rock with their feet, three or four times, to stop
the velocity of their motion; and when they
have got upon the base below, they at once
seem fixed and secure. In fact, to see them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
thus leaping among the precipices, they seem
rather to have wings than legs, so great is the
strength of their nerves. Some writers have
pretended that they use their horns for climbing
and descending the precipices. I have seen
and killed many of these animals, but I never
saw them use their horns for that purpose, nor
have I ever found any hunter who could confirm
this assertion. The chamois ascends and
descends precipices with great ease, by the agility
and strength of his legs, which are very
long; the hind ones being somewhat the longest
and always crooked, assist them in throwing
themselves forwards, and are of great service
by breaking the force of the fall. It is asserted,
that when they feed, one of them is deputed
to stand sentinel for the security of the rest. I
have seen many flocks of these animals, but
never observed that to be the case. It is certain
that when there are a great number of them
there will always be some looking about while
the rest are grazing; but there is nothing in
this particularly distinguishable from a flock of
sheep; for the first who perceives any danger
warns all the rest, and in an instant the terror
with which he is struck spreads through the
whole flock. During the rigours of winter,
and in the deep snows, the chamois retreats to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the lower forests, and feeds upon the pine-leaves,
buds of trees, bushes, or such dry or
green shrubs and grass as they can discover by
scratching off the snow with their feet. The
more craggy and uneven the forest, the more
this animal is pleased with its abode. The
hunting of the chamois is very difficult, and
laborious. The most usual way is by hiding
behind some of the clefts of the rocks, and
shooting them as they pass; for this method
the sportsman is obliged to take great precaution
in concealing himself; observing, at the
same time, to keep the wind in his face. Others
hunt this animal as they do the stag, by placing
some of the hunters at all the narrow
passages, while others beat round to alarm the
game. Men are more proper for this sort of
hunting than dogs, who when employed, often
disperse the chamois too soon, when they immediately
fly to a considerable distance; the
men also find it a dangerous sport, for when
the animal observes his retreat shut up, he directly
makes at the hunter with his head, and
frequently knocks him down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With regard to the specific virtues attributed
to the blood of the wild goat, in the cure
of certain diseases, especially in the pleurisy,
a virtue thought to belong particularly to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
animal, and which would indicate it to be of
a particular nature, it is now known that the
blood of the chamois, and also of the domestic
he-goat, has the same properties when fed on
the same aromatic herbs; so that even by this
property these three animals appear to be
united in the same species.</p>

<p>Besides the Syrian goat, which we formerly
mentioned as having pendulous ears,
there is a species in Madagascar, which are
much larger, and with pendulous ears so long,
that they hang entirely over their eyes, which
obliges the animal to be almost continually
throwing them back, and therefore whenever
pursued, he invariably makes to the rising
ground. The accounts which we received of
this animal came from M. Comerson, but
were not sufficiently particular to determine
whether it was a different species or only a
variety of the Syrian race with pendulous ears.</p>

<p>M. le Vicomte de QuerhoÃ«nt says, that the
goats left on Ascension Island have increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
abundantly, but they appear very thin, and so
weak, that men can often outrun them; they
are of a very dark brown, much less than our
goals, and in the nights conceal themselves in
the holes of the mountains.</p>

<p>There is a species of goat found in Hungary,
Poland, Tartary, and in South Siberia,
which the Russians call <i>Saigak</i>, or <i>Saiga</i>; it
bears a resemblance to the domestic goat in
the shape of its body and its hair; but by the
form of the horns, and the want of a beard, it
approaches nearer to the antelopes, and, in
fact, appears to be the shade between those
two animals; for the horns of the saiga are in
every respect like those of the antelope; they
have the same form, transverse rings, longitudinal
streaks, &amp;c. and they differ only by
the colour. The horns of the antelopes are
black and opaque; those of the saiga, on the
contrary, are whitish and transparent. Gesner
has mentioned this animal under the name
of <i>colus</i>, and Gmelin under that of <i>saiga</i>.
The horns which are in the royal cabinet, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sent under the denomination of <i>the horns of
the Hungarian buck</i>; they are so transparent
and so clear, that they are used for the same
purpose as tortoise-shell.</p>

<p>The saiga, by its natural habits, resembles
more the antelopes, than the wild or chamois
goats; for it does not delight in mountainous
countries, but lives on the hills and plains.
Like them also he moves by bounds and leaps;
he is very swift, and his flesh much better
eating than that of either the tame or wild
goat.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> Pallas thinks that the saiga which is found in Hungary,
Transylvania, Wallachia, and in Greece, is also to be found
in the island of Candia; and he thinks that the <i>strepsiceros</i>
of Belon ought to be considered as such. Buffon, however,
was not of that opinion, who referred the <i>strepsiceros</i> of
Belon to the class of sheep.</p></div>

<p>There have been thirteen species, or, at
least, thirteen distinct varieties made of these
animals; in this uncertainty, whether they are
varieties, or species, we thought it best to treat
of them all together, assigning to each a particular
name. The first of these animals, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
only one to which we retain the generic name
of <i>gazelle</i>, is the common <i>gazelle</i>, (<a href="#FIG_153"><i>fig. 153.</i></a>)
which is found in Syria, Mesopotamia, and
the other provinces of the Levant, as well as
in Barbary, and in all the northern parts of
Africa. The horns of this animal are about a
foot long, entirely annulated at the base, lessening
into half-rings towards the extremities
which are smooth. They are not only surrounded
with rings, but also furrowed longitudinally
by small streaks. These rings mark
the years of their growth, which is commonly
about twelve or thirteen. The gazelles in general,
and this tribe in particular, greatly resemble
the roe-buck in the proportions of the
body, natural functions, swiftness, and the
brightness and beauty of the eyes. These resemblances
would tempt us to think, as the
roe-buck does not exist in the same countries
with the gazelle, that the latter was only a degeneration
of the first; or, that the roe-buck
is a gazelle, whose nature had been altered by
the influence of the climate and effects of food,
did not the gazelles differ from the roe-buck
in the nature of their horns; those of the roe-buck
are a kind of solid <i>wood</i>, which fall off,
and are renewed every year, like those of the
stag; the horns of the gazelles, on the contrary,
are hollow and permanent like those of
the goat. The roe-buck has also no gall-bladder,
which is to be found in the gazelle.
The gazelles have, in common with the roe-bucks,
deep pits under the eyes, and they resemble
each other still more in the colour and
quality of the hair, in the bunches upon their
leg, which only differ in being upon the fore-legs
of the gazelle, and upon the hinder legs
of the roe-buck. The gazelles, therefore,
seem to be intermediate animals between the
roe-bucks and goats; but, when we consider
that the roe-buck is an animal which is to be
found in both continents, and that the goats,
on the contrary, as well as the gazelles, belong
only to the old world, we shall be induced
to conclude that the goats and gazelles are
more nearly related to each other, than they
are to the roe-buck. The only characters peculiar
to the gazelles, are the transversed rings
and longitudinal depressions on the horns, the
bunches of hair on the fore-legs, the thick
streaks of black, brown, or red hair upon the
lower part of the sides, and three streaks of
whitish hair to the internal surface of the
ears.</p>

<p>The second gazelle is an animal found in
Senegal, which M. Adanson informs us, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
there called <i>kevel</i>. It is something less than
the former, and nearly of the size of a small
roe-buck; it differs also in its eyes, which are
much larger; and its horns, instead of being
round, are flattened on the sides, and this
flattening of the horns is not a sexual difference;
the male and female gazelles have them
round, or more properly speaking, compressed;
in other respects, they entirely resemble
each other. They both have yellow-coloured
hair, thighs and belly white, the tail black, a
brown stripe under the flank, three white
streaks in the ears, black horns surrounded
with rings, with the longitudinal depressions,
&amp;c. but it is certain, that the number of these
rings is greater in the kevel than in the gazelle,
the last having generally but twelve or
thirteen, and the former at least fourteen,
and often eighteen or twenty.</p>

<p>The third is called <i>corine</i> (<a href="#FIG_154"><i>fig. 154.</i></a>) from
<i>korin</i>, the name it bears in Senegal. It greatly
resembles the gazelle and the kevel, but is still
less than either; its horns are also thinner and
smoother, the rings being scarcely discernible.
M. Adanson, who communicated to me his
description of this animal, says, that it seemed
a little tending to the chamois goat, but that it
is much smaller, being in length only two feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and a half, and not quite two feet in height;
that its ears are four inches and a half long,
its tail three inches, its horns six inches long,
and not an inch thick; that they are two inches
distant from each other at the base, and about
five or six at their extremities; that, instead of
annular prominences, they have only transverse
wrinkles very close to each other in the lower
part, and more distant in the upper, and that
these wrinkles, which are in the place of rings,
are about sixteen in number; that its hair is
short, fine, and glossy, yellow on the back and
flanks, and white under the belly and the inside
of the thighs and a black tail; and that there are
some of these animals whose bodies are often
sprinkled with irregular white spots.</p>

<p>These differences between the gazelle, the
kevel, and the corine, although very apparent,
especially in the corine, do not appear to be
essential, nor sufficient to divide these animals
into different species; for they resemble each
other so much in every other respect, that they
seem to be all three of the same species, more
or less varied by the influence of climate and
food. There is much less difference between
the kevel and the gazelle, than the corine, whose
horns in particular bear no resemblance to
those of the other two; but all three have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
same natural habits; they assemble and feed
together in herds; they are of mild dispositions,
and easily accustomed to a domestic state
and the flesh of all three is very good to eat.
We think ourselves therefore, authorised to
conclude that the gazelle and kevel are certainly
of the same species, and that it is uncertain,
whether the corine be only a variety of
the same species or whether it be a different
one.</p>

<p>In the royal cabinet of France, there are
skins of these three different antelopes, besides
which, there is a horn that bears a great resemblance
to those of the gazelle and kevel, but
much larger; this horn is engraven in the works
of Aldrovandus, <i>Lib.</i> I. <i>de Bisulcis, c.</i> xxi.
Its thickness and length seem to indicate a
much bigger animal than the common gazelle,
and it appears to me to belong to an antelope
which the Turks call <i>tzeiran</i>, and the Persians
<i>ahu</i>. This animal, according to Olearius, in
some measure resembles our fallow-deer, except
being rather of a red than yellow colour;
the horns, likewise, are without antlers, and
rest upon the back, &amp;c. M. Gmelin, who describes
it under the name of <i>dsheren</i> says, it
resembles the roe-buck, with this exception,
that the horns like those of the wild goat,
are hollow and never fall off. He also adds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that in proportion as the horns increase in
growth, the cartilage of the larynx thickens,
and forms a considerable prominence under the
throat when the animals are advanced in years.
According to K&oelig;mpfer the <i>ahu</i> differs not in
the least from the stag in its form, but that his
horns appear nearer to those of the goat, which
are single, black, and annulated, as far as the
middle, &amp;c. Some other authors have likewise
made mention of this species of antelope
under the name of <i>geiram</i> and <i>jarain</i>, which
it is easy to restore, as well as that of <i>dsheren</i>
to the primitive name of <i>tzeiran</i>. This antelope
is common in South Tartary, in Persia,
in Turkey, and is also to be met with in the
East Indies.</p>

<p>To these four first species, or races of antelopes,
may be added two other animals, which
greatly resemble them; the first is called <i>koba</i>
at Senegal where the French have stiled it
the <i>great brown cow</i>; the second is also a native
of Senegal, and is there called <i>kob</i>, but
our countrymen denominate it the <i>small brown
cow</i>. The horns of the kob greatly resemble
those of the gazelle and kevel, but the shape of
the head is different, the muzzle is longer, and
there are no pits under the eyes. The koba
is much larger than the kob; the latter is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the size of the fallow-deer, and the other is as
large as the stag. From the remarks of M.
Adanson, it appears that the <i>koba</i> is five feet
long, from the extremity of the muzzle to the
insertion of the tail; that its head is fifteen
inches, its ears nine, and its horns from nineteen
to twenty, that its horns are flattened on
the sides and surrounded with ten or twelve
rings, while those of the <i>kob</i> have only eight or
nine, and are not more than a foot in length.</p>

<p>The seventh animal of this species is found
in the Levant but more commonly in Egypt,
and in Arabia. We call it, from its Arabian
name, <i>algazel</i>; it is shaped pretty much
like the other antelopes, and is nearly the size
of the fallow-deer, but its horns are long, thin,
and but little bent till toward their extremities,
when they turn short with a sharp flexion;
they are black and almost smooth, and the annular
prominence scarcely observable, except
towards the base, where they are a little more
visible. They are about three feet in length,
while those of the gazelle are not more than one
foot, those of the kevel fourteen and fifteen
inches, and those of the corine (which, nevertheless
resembles this the most) only six or seven
inches.</p>

<p>The eighth animal is generally called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<i>Bezoar antelope</i>, but by the eastern nations
<i>pasan</i>, which name we retain. A horn of this
animal is very well represented in the German
Ephemerides, and the figure of the animal itself
has been given by K&oelig;mpfer, but his
description is faulty in the horns, which are
neither sufficiently long nor straight. His description
likewise, does not appear to be exact,
for he says, that this animal has a beard like
the he-goat; and yet, he has given a figure
of it without one, which seems more conformable
to truth; for the want of a beard is the
principal character by which antelopes are distinguished
from goats. This antelope is of the
size of our domestic he-goat, and has the
colour, shape, and agility of the stag. We
have seen a skull of this animal with the horns
on it, and two other horns separate. The
horns which are engraved in <i>Aldrovandus, de
quad. Bisulcis</i>, p. 765. C. 24 <i>de Orige</i>, bear a
great resemblance to these. In most respects,
the <i>algazel</i> and the <i>pasan</i>, appear to have a
great affinity; they are also natives of the same
climate, and are found in the Levant, Egypt,
Arabia, and Persia; but the algazel feeds upon
the plains, and the pasan is only found on
the mountains. The flesh of both is very good
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The ninth antelope is an animal which, according
to M. Adanson, is called <i>nangueur</i>, or
<i>nanguer</i> (<a href="#FIG_155"><i>fig. 155.</i></a>) at Senegal. It is three feet
and a half long, and two feet and a half high; it
is of the colour of the roe-buck, yellow on the
upper part of the body, white under the belly
and inside of the thighs, with a spot of the same
colour under the neck. Its horns are permanent
like those of the other antelopes, and are
about six or seven inches in length; they are
black and round, but what is singular, they
bend forwards, at the points nearly in the same
manner as those of the chamois goats bend
backwards. These nauguers are very beautiful
animals, and very easy to tame. All these
characters, and principally that of the horns
bending forward, induces me to think, that
the nanguer may possibly be the dama, or
fallow-deer, of the ancients. &ldquo;Cornua rupicapris
in dorsum adunca, damis in adversum,&rdquo;
says Pliny. As these are the only animals
who have their horns bent in this manner,
we may presume that the nanguer of Africa,
is the dama of the ancients; especially, as
Pliny says in another place, that the dama is
only to be found in Africa. In short, by the
testimonies of other ancient authors, we find,
that the dama was a timid and peaceable animal,
who had no other resource for his safety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
than in the swiftness of his running. The
animal which Caius has given the figure and
description of, under the name <i>dama Plinii</i>
being found, according to that author&rsquo;s own
testimony in the north of Great Britain and
in Spain, cannot possibly be the dama mentioned
by Pliny, because he says, it was only to be
found in Africa. Besides, this animal, which
Caius has described, is furnished with beard
like a goat, and not one of the ancients has
spoken of the dama as having a beard. I am inclined
therefore to believe that this dama of Caius
is only a goat, whose horns being a little bent
at their extremities, like those of the common
gazelle, made him imagine it to be the dama
of the ancients. Besides this character of
the horns being bent forwards, which is the
most certain index of the dama, is not properly
marked in any other animal except the
nanguer of Africa. From the remarks of M.
Adanson, it appears, there are three varieties
of these nanguers, which only differ in the colour
of the hair, but all their horns bend forwards
in a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<p>The tenth gazelle is a very common animal
in Barbary and Mauritania, and which the
English call <i>antelope</i>, a name we shall likewise
adopt. This animal is of the size of a roe-buck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and greatly resembles the gazelle and
the kevel, yet it differs from them in so many
particulars, that it may be looked upon as
a different species. The antelope has deeper
eye-pits than the gazelle; its horns are near
fourteen inches long almost touching each
other at the bottom, yet their points are fifteen
or sixteen inches asunder. They are surrounded
with rings and semi-rings like the gazelle
and kevel, but not so distinguishable; but
what particularly discriminates the antelope,
is its horns having a double flexion, which
gives them the appearance of an antique lyre.
The antelope, like other gazelles, is yellow on
the back, and white under the belly; but
these two colours are not separated by the black
streak which is to be found in all the rest of
the gazelle kind.</p>

<p>There seems to be different races of the antelope
as there are in the other gazelles. 1. In
the royal cabinet is a horn, which must be
attributed to a much larger antelope than that
we have been speaking of; it is called <i>lidmee</i>,
a name, which according to Dr. Shaw, the Africans
give to the antelopes. 2. In the cabinet of
the Marquis de Marigny is a kind of an offensive
weapon composed of two sharp-pointed horns
about the length of a foot and a half which, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their double flexion, seem to belong to a much
smaller antelope than any of the rest. It must
be very common in the Indies, as their Faquirs,
and other priests, carry this sort of weapon
as a mark of dignity. We shall call it
the <i>Indian antelope</i>, from its having the appearance
of being only a simple variety of the
<i>African species</i>.</p>

<p>By this enumeration of the gazelles, or antelopes,
we find there are twelve species, or
distinct varieties: viz. 1. The common gazelle;
2. The kevel; 3. The corine; 4. The
tzeiran; 5. The koba, or great brown cow;
6. The kob, or small brown cow; 7. The
algazel, or antelope of Egypt; 8. The pasan,
or pretended bezoar; 9. The nanguer,
or dama of the ancients; 10. The antelope;
11. The lidmÃ©e; and, 12. The Indian
antelope. After having carefully compared
them, we are induced to conclude that the
common gazelle, kevel, and corine, are only
three varieties of one species: 2. That the
tzeiran, koba, and kob, are varieties of another:
3. That the algazel and the pasan are
probably only two varieties of the same species;
and that the name <i>bezoar-gazelle</i>, which
has been given to the pasan, is no distinctive
character; for we think ourselves able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
prove, that the Oriental bezoar does not come
from the pasan alone, but from all the gazelles
and goats which live in the mountains of
Asia: 4. That the nanguers, whose horns are
bent forwards, and of which there are two or
three varieties, have been indicated by the ancients
under the name of the <i>dama</i>: 5. That
the antelopes, which are three or four in number,
and differ from all others by the double
flexion of their horns, were also known to the
ancients by the names of <i>strepsiceros</i>, and <i>addax</i>.
All these animals are to be found in
Asia and Africa that is in the old continent,
and to these five principal species, which
contain twelve very distinct varieties, we shall
not add two or three other kinds, of America,
to which the indefinite name of <i>gazelle</i> has
also been given, although they are different
from all those we have already noticed; as it
would only increase the confusion, which is
already too great. We shall give the history
of these American animals, under their real
names of Mezame, TemamaÃ§ame, &amp;c. and
shall here speak only of those animals of this
species which are found in Africa and Asia:
we shall also refer to the following articles,
several other animals of Africa and Asia,
which have been considered as antelopes or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
goats, though they appear to be an intermediate
species; such as the bubalus, or Barbary
cow, the condoma, the guib, the grimm, &amp;c.
without including the chevrotains, which greatly
resemble the small goats or antelopes, but
of which we shall speak in a separate article.</p>

<p>It is now easy to perceive how difficult it
was to arrange all these animals, which amount
to thirty, ten goats, twelve or thirteen antelopes,
three or four of the bubalus, and as
many chevrotains, all different from each other;
many of them were unknown, the others confusedly
mentioned by naturalists, and confounded
one for another by travellers. This
is the third time that I have written their history,
and I must say, that the trouble much
exceeded the produce, though I have done as
much as possible with the materials and knowledge
I was able to acquire.</p>

<p>By comparing the remarks which have been
made by ancient and modern authors, with the
knowledge we have acquired by experience, we
find, 1. That the <i>dorcas</i> of Aristotle is not the
gazelle but the roe-buck; notwithstanding that
this name has been used by Ãlian, not only to
denote wild goats in general but particularly
the Lybian or common gazelle. 2. That the
<i>strepsiceros</i> of Pliny, or the <i>addax</i> of the Africans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
is the antelope. 3. That the <i>dama</i> of
Pliny is the <i>nanguer</i> of Africa, and not our
fallow-deer, or any other European animal.
4. That the <i>prox</i> of Aristotle agrees with the
<i>zorkes</i> of Ãlian, and is the same with the
<i>platycerotas</i> of the more modern Greeks, which
name the Latins have adopted to denote the
fallow-deer, &ldquo;<i>Animalium quorumdam cornua
in palmas finxit natura; digitosque emisis exiis
unde platycerotas vocant</i>,&rdquo; says Pliny. 5.
That the pygargos of the Greeks is probably
the gazelle of Egypt, or that of Persia; that is,
the <i>algazel</i> or <i>pasan</i>. The word <i>pygargos</i> is
only used by Aristotle to denote a bird, the
<i>white-tailed eagle</i>; but Pliny employed it to
denote a quadruped. The etymology of pygargus
indicates, 1. An animal with white
haunches, such as the roe-bucks or gazelles. 2.
A timid animal; the ancients imagining that
white thighs were an index of timidity, attributed
the intrepidity of Hercules to his having
black ones. But as almost every author,
who speaks of the pygargus as a quadruped,
mentions also the roe-buck; it is clear that the
name can only be applied to some species of
gazelle, which is different from the dorcas Lybica,
or common gazelle, and from the strepsiceros,
or antelope, which the same authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
speak of. We therefore think, that the <i>pygargus</i>
denotes the <i>algazel</i> or <i>gazelle</i> of Egypt,
which must have been known to the Greeks as
well as to the Hebrews; for we find the name
of pygargus in the Septuagint version<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>,
among the number of animals whose flesh is
deemed clean; the Jews, therefore, eat the
pygargus, or that species of gazelle which is
common in Egypt and the adjacent countries.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_V_22" id="Footnote_V_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_V_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> Deuteronomy, chap. xiv.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Russel, in his History of Aleppo, says,
that near that city there are two sorts of gazelles;
the one called the <i>mountain gazelle</i>,
which is the most beautiful, and whose hair on
the neck and back is of a deep brown; the
other, called the <i>gazelle of the valley</i>, which is
neither so swift nor so well made as the first,
and whose hair is also much paler. He adds,
that these animals run so quick and so long that
the swiftest dogs cannot catch them, without
the assistance of a falcon; that in winter the
gazelles are lean, but yet their flesh is of a good
flavour; that in summer it abounds with fat,
like our venison; and that those which are fed
at home do not eat so well as the wild ones.
From this testimony of Mr. Russel, and from
that of M. Hasselquist, we may perceive that
the gazelles of Aleppo are not the common gazelles,
but those of Egypt, whose horns are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
straight, long, and black, and whose flesh is
excellent eating. We find also from these
testimonies, that they are half domestic animals;
that they have been early tamed, and
that consequently many different varieties or
kinds have been formed among them, as well
as in other domestic animals. These Aleppo
gazelles are the same therefore as those we have
called algazells, and are still more abundant in
the Thebaid and Upper Egypt than the environs
of Aleppo. They feed on aromatic herbs
and the tender bark of young trees: they are
commonly found in herds, or rather in families,
consisting of five or six. Their cry resembles
that of the goat. They are hunted
not only with dogs, assisted by the falcon,
but also with the <i>ounce</i><a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_W_23" id="Footnote_W_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> See history of this animal, page 68, vol. VII.</p></div>

<p>In some places they take the wild gazelles by
means of a tame one, to the horns of which
they fasten a snare made of ropes. When a
herd of wild gazelles is found, the tame one is
sent among them, but he no sooner approaches
than one of the males of the wild herd advances
to oppose him, and in butting with his horns
is soon entangled in the noose. In this struggle
they both commonly fall to the ground,
when the hunter coming up kills the one and
disengages the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The antelopes, especially the largest sort, are
much more common in Africa than in India,
they are stronger and fiercer than the other gazelles,
from which they are easily distinguished
by the double flexion of their horns; and not
having either the black or brown streak on
their sides. The middling antelopes are about
the size of the fallow-deer; their horns are
very black, their belly very white, and their
fore-legs shorter than the hind ones. They
are well made, and extremely clean animals,
never lying down but in dry places; they are
likewise very swift, watchful, and apprehensive
of danger; in open places they look round,
and when they see a man, a dog, or any other
enemy, they fly with all speed. But, notwithstanding
this natural timidity, they have
a kind of courage, for if surprised, they turn
suddenly round, and face those who attack
them with great firmness.</p>

<p>The antelopes, in general, have large black
eyes, very brilliant, and so beautiful that the
Orientals employ them proverbially, in praising
the eyes of their mistresses. A gazelle-eyed
beauty is the highest compliment a lover can
pay. Their limbs are finer and more delicate
than those of the roe-buck; their hair is as
short, and more soft and glossy; their hind
legs are longer than those before; like the hare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
therefore, they have greater security in ascending
than in descending steep places. Their
swiftness is equal to that of the roe-buck; but
the latter hastens on by bounds, while the
former runs in an uninterrupted course.
Most of them are yellow upon the back, white
under the belly, with a black stripe which separates
these two colours below the flanks.
Their tails are of various lengths, but always
covered with a pretty long blackish hair; their
ears are long, erect, open, and terminating in a
point: they all have cloven hoofs nearly like
the sheep; both males and females have permanent
horns, but the latter have them thinner
and shorter than the former.</p>

<p>Such is the whole information which we
have been able to acquire concerning the
different species of gazelles, and their natural
dispositions and habits. Let us now see how
far naturalists have been right in attributing
the production of the oriental <i>bezoar</i>
to one kind of those animals only; and
whether this animal be really the <i>pasan</i> or
<i>pazan</i>, which they have described by the
name of the <i>bezoar gazel</i>. In examining
the description and the figures of K&oelig;mpfer,
who has written a great deal on this subject,
it is doubtful whether he means that the pazan
or the algazel is the only animal which produces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the oriental bezoar. If we consult other
naturalists and travellers, we shall be tempted
to believe that this stone is the production not
only of gazelles but of wild and domestic
goats, and even sheep, the formation of which
probably depends more on the temperature of
the climate, and the quality of the food, than
on the nature or the species of the animal.
If we believe Rumphius, Seba, and some other
authors, the true oriental bezoar is the production
of apes and not of gazelles, goats, or
sheep. But this opinion of Rumphius and
Seba is not founded, for we have seen many
of these concretions, to which the name of ape
bezoar has been given, but they are quite
different from the oriental bezoar, which is
certainly produced by a ruminating animal,
and is easily distinguished from all other
bezoars by its shape, substance, and colour,
which is generally that of an olive, and brown
within, while the <i>occidental</i> bezoar is of a pale
yellow. The substance of the first is soft and
porous; that of the last hard, dry, and as it
were petrified. Besides, as prodigious quantities
of the oriental bezoar was consumed in
the last century; and as it was used in Europe
and Asia for all cases in which our present
physicians give cordial medicines, and antidotes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
against poison, may we not presume,
from the great quantities which were formerly,
and are still, in some degree, consumed, that
this stone is produced, not from a single
species of animal but from many, and that it
is equally the production of gazelles, goats,
and sheep, who cannot produce it but in certain
climates of the Levant and Indies.</p>

<p>In all that has been written on this subject
we have not met with one distinct observation,
nor a single decisive argument. It only appears,
by what Monard, Garcias, Clusius,
Aldrovandus, and others, have said, that the
oriental bezoar animal is not the common and
domestic goat, but a species of wild goat
which they have not characterised. Thus,
likewise, all that can be gathered from
K&oelig;mpfer is, that the bezoar animal is a kind
of wild goat, or rather gazelle; but by the
testimonies of Thevenot, Chardin, and Tavernier,
it seems that this stone is obtained more
from sheep and wild or domestic goats, than
from gazelles. What gives great weight to
the assertions of these travellers is, that they
speak from ocular inspection, and because,
although they do not mention the gazelles on
this occasion, there is no appearance of their
being deceived, as they knew them perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
well, and mention them in other parts of their
works. We must not, therefore, conclude,
with our ancient naturalists, that the oriental
bezoar is exclusively the production of a particular
species of gazelle, for I must own, that
after having examined not only the testimonies
of authors, but such facts as might decide
the question, I am inclined to believe,
that this stone proceeds equally from the
greatest number of ruminating animals, but
more commonly from goats and gazelles.
This stone is formed of concentric layers,
and often contains foreign matter in its centre.
I have endeavoured to find out the nature of
this matter, which serves as a nucleus to the
bezoar, supposing from that a judgment might
be formed of the animal that possesses them.
This nucleus is of various kinds; sometimes
I found them to consist of pieces of flint, stones
of plumbs, tamarinds, seeds of cassia, and particularly
pieces of straw and buds of trees,
therefore I could not hesitate to attribute this
production to those animals which brouze
upon shrubs and leaves.</p>

<p>The oriental bezoar then is clearly not the
production of one particular animal but of
many different ones; and it is not difficult to
reconcile the testimonies of most travellers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
with this opinion. The ancients, both Greeks
and Latins, have no knowledge of the bezoar.
Galen is the first who speaks of its virtues as
an antidote against poison. The Arabs, likewise,
praise the bezoar as possessing those
qualities; but neither the Greeks, Latins, nor
Arabians, particularly describe the animals
which produce it. Rabi Moses, an Egyptian,
only says, that some pretend this stone is formed
in the angles of the eyes, and others in the
gall-bladder of the eastern sheep. Indeed there
are bezoars, or, more properly speaking, concretions,
formed in the eyes of stags, and some
other animals; but these concretions are very
different from the oriental bezoar, and all the
concretions in the gall-bladder are of a light,
oily, and inflammable matter, which bears no
resemblance to the substance of the bezoar.
Andreas Lacuna, a Spanish physician, says, in
his Commentaries on Dioscorides, that the
oriental bezoar is extracted from a certain
kind of wild goat which feeds in the mountains
of Persia.   Amatus Lusitanus confirms Lacuna&rsquo;s
remarks, and adds, that this mountain-goat
greatly resembles our stag. Monard,
who quotes all three, still more positively
affirms, that this stone is produced from the
internal parts of a mountain-goat in India, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
which, he says, I have affixed the name of
<i>cervi-capra</i>, because it inclines both to the
goat and the stag; for it is nearly of the size
and shape of the stag, but its horns, like those
of the goat, are very simple, and very much
bent backwards. Garcias ab Horto says, that
in Corasson, and in Persia, there is a kind of
he-goats, called <i>pasans</i>, and that it is in their
stomachs the oriental bezoar is formed; that
as well as in Persia it is found in Malacca, and
near Cape Comorin, and that in great numbers
of the goats killed for the subsistence of
the troops these stones are regularly sought for
and found in their stomachs. Christopher
Acosta confirms what Garcias and Monard
have said, without adding any thing new; in
short, not to omit any thing which has a relation
to the historical detail of this stone,
K&oelig;mpfer, a man of more learning than exactness,
being in the province of Laar, in
Persia, says, that he went with the natives of
that country to hunt the <i>pasan</i>, which produces
the bezoar, and that he saw them extract
that stone; besides which, he affirms,
that the true oriental bezoar proceeds from
this animal; that the buck <i>ahu</i>, of which he
has also given a figure, produces the bezoar,
but that they are of a very inferior quality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
By his figures of the pasan and ahu we might
be induced to believe, that the first represents
the common gazelle rather than the true pasan;
and from his description we might imagine his
pasan to be a he-goat and not a gazelle, as he
gives it a beard resembling that of the goat;
and from the name <i>ahu</i>, which he gives to
his other buck, as well as by his second figure,
we might rather suppose it to be the wild goat
than the true ahu, which is our tzeiran, or
large gazelle. What is yet more singular,
K&oelig;mpfer, who seems willing to decide the
species of animal that produces the oriental
bezoar, and affirms, that it is the wild buck
called the pasan, quotes, at the same time,
a man, whose word, he says, may be relied
on, who felt the bezoar stones in the belly of
the gazelles of Golconda. Thus all the positive
conclusions that can be drawn from K&oelig;mpfer
is, that there are two kinds of wild goats, the
pasan and ahu, which produce the bezoar in
Persia, and that in the Indies this stone is
likewise found in the gazelles.</p>

<p>Chardin positively says, that oriental bezoar
is found in the wild and domestic goats on the
shore of the Persian gulph, and in many provinces
of India; and that in Persia it is also to
be met with in sheep. Dutch travellers say the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
same; Tavernier still more positively affirms,
that they are found in the stomachs of domestic
goats, whose hair is as fine as silk,
and that having bought six of these goats
alive, he extracted from them seventeen bezoar
stones, and a portion of another, about the
size of half a nut, and then adds, that there
are other bezoars supposed to proceed from
apes, the virtues of which are still greater
than those of the goats; that there is also cow
bezoar, but the virtues are inferior to the
others, &amp;c. What can we infer from such a
variety of opinions and testimonies? What
can we conclude from them? unless it be admitted
that the oriental bezoar proceeds not
from one single species but from many different
animals, particularly gazelles and goats.</p>

<p>With respect to the occidental bezoar we
can affirm they proceed neither from goats
nor gazelles, for we shall prove there is neither
of them, nor even any animal of that genus,
in all the extent of the new world. Instead
of gazelles we only meet with roe-bucks in
the woods of America; instead of wild goats
and sheep, lamas and pacos animals of a quite
different nature, and of which we have already
treated. The ancient Peruvians had no other
cattle, and, at the same time, that these two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
species are almost reduced to a domestic state,
they subsisted in much greater numbers in their
natural condition upon the mountains. The
wild lamas were called <i>huanacus</i>, and the
pacos <i>vicunnas</i>; from whence the French have
derived the name of <i>vigogne</i>, which denotes
the same animal as the pacos; both the pacos
and the lamas produce bezoars, but the tame
ones more seldom than the wild.</p>

<p>M. Daubenton, who has more minutely inspected
the nature of bezoar stones than any
other person, thinks they are composed of
something similar to that which fastens itself
to the teeth of ruminating animals in the form
of a shining tartareous matter; and it is evident,
from the collection of bezoars, of which
there are a great number in the royal cabinet,
that there are essential differences between the
oriental and occidental bezoars. Thus the
East Indian goats, or the gazelles of Persia,
are not the only animals which produce the
concretions, called bezoars for the chamois,
and, perhaps, the wild goat of the Alps,
the he-goats of Guinea, and many animals
of America, afford this substance; and,
if we comprehend under this name all concretions
of this nature, which are met with in
different animals, we may be assured, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
most quadrupeds, excepting carnivorous ones,
and even crocodiles and alligators, produce
bezoars.</p>

<p>To form, therefore, a clear idea of these concretions
it will be necessary to divide them into
several classes, and refer them to the animals
which produce them, and the climates and
food which mostly assist in their production.</p>

<p>First, then, the stones formed in the bladder
and kidneys of men, and other animals, must
be distinguished from the class of bezoar, and
described by the name of <i>calculi</i>, their substance
being quite different from that of the
bezoars; they are easily known by their
weight, their urinous smell, and their structure,
which is not regular, nor formed with
concentric layers, like that of the bezoar.</p>

<p>2. The concretions that are often found in
the gall-bladders and liver, of the human species,
and other animals, must not be regarded
as bezoars; they may easily be distinguished
by their lightness, colour, and inflammability;
besides they are not formed by layers encircled
round a nucleus, as in the bezoar.</p>

<p>3. The balls frequently found in the stomachs
of animals, and especially in those that ruminate,
are not true bezoars. These balls, which
are called <i>Ã¦gagropili</i>, are composed internally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the hair the animal has licked off his hide
and swallowed, or from hard roots, which he
could not digest, their external part is encrusted
with a viscous substance, something
like that of the bezoar. The <i>Ã¦gagropili</i>,
therefore, have nothing in them, except this
external layer, in common with the bezoar,
and simple inspection is sufficient to distinguish
one from the other.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ãgagropili</i> are often found in the animals
of temperate climates, but never any bezoars.
Our oxen and cows, the Alpine chamois,
and the porcupine of Italy, produce only
<i>Ã¦gagropili</i>. Animals of hotter countries, on
the contrary, only produce bezoars. The elephant,
the rhinoceros, the goats, the gazelles
of Asia and Africa, the lama of Peru, and
others, produce, instead of <i>Ã¦gagropili</i>, solid
bezoars, whose substance and size vary according
to the difference of the animals and the
climates in which they live.</p>

<p>5. The bezoars, to which such virtues and
properties have been attributed, are the oriental
kind, which, as we have said, proceed from
goats, gazelles, and sheep, which feed on the
mountains of Asia. The bezoar of an inferior
quality, which is called <i>occidental</i>, proceeds
from the lamas and pacos, which are found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the mountains of South America. In a word,
the goats and gazelles of Africa also produce
bezoars, but not of so good a quality as those
of Asia.</p>

<p>From all these facts we may conclude, that,
in general, the bezoar is only a residue of vegetable
nutriment which is not to be found in
carnivorous animals, and is peculiar to those
who feed on plants; that in the southern mountains
of Asia, the herbs being stronger than in
any other part of the world, the bezoar, which
is the residue of that food, has also more virtues
than any other; that in America, where
the heat is less, and the mountain herbs being
weaker, the bezoars produced there are also
inferior; and that in Europe, where the herbs
are still weaker, and in all the valleys of both
continents, where they are coarse, no bezoars
are produced, but only <i>Ã¦gagropili</i>, which
contain nothing but hair, roots, or filaments,
which the animal was unable to digest.</p>

HAVE AN AFFINITY TO THE GAZELLES
AND GOATS.</a></p>

<p>We have already taken notice in our description
of the buffalo, of the name bubalus
being improperly applied to that animal. This
name belonged formerly to the animal which
we are now about to describe, and which is of
a very distant nature from the buffalo. It resembles
the stag, the gazelle, and the ox, in
many respects; to the stag, by the size and
shape of its body, particularly in its legs, but
its horns are permanent, and nearly like those
of the largest gazelles, to which it has an affinity
both in this character and in its natural
habits; its head, however, is much longer than
that of the gazelles, or even that of the stags.
He resembles the ox by the length of the muzzle
and the disposition of the bones of the
head, the <i>cranium</i> not advancing beyond the
<i>os frontalis</i>: these different marks of conformation,
joined to its ancient name, being forgotten,
is the reason why it has obtained the
several names of <i>busephalus</i>, the bull-stag, <i>bucula-cervina</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the cow-hind, the Barbary cow,
&amp;c. Even the name of <i>bubalus</i> comes from
<i>bubulus</i>, and has been applied to this animal
from its similitude to the ox.</p>

<p>The head of the bubalus is narrow and very
long, the eyes are placed very high, the forehead
very short and narrow, the horns permanent,
black, thick, and very closely annulated:
they are close to each other at the root,
but spread very distant at their extremities;
they are crooked backwards, and twisted like
a corkscrew; his shoulders are so elevated
that they form a sort of bunch upon the withers;
the tail is nearly a foot long, and furnished
with a bunch of hair at its extremity;
and the ears resemble those of the antelope.
Kolbe calls this animal by the name of <i>elk</i>, although
it only resembles the elk by its hair
being finer at the root, than in the middle or
at the points; this character is peculiar to these
two animals, for the hair of almost every other
quadruped is thicker at the root than at the
middle and point. The hair is nearly of the
same colour as the elk, though much shorter,
thinner, and softer. These alone are the resemblances
between the bubalus and the elk;
in every other respect these two animals are
entirely different. The horns of the elk are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
larger and heavier than those of the stag, and
are renewed every year; the bubalus, on the
contrary, does not shed its horns, but they continue
their growth during life, and in form
and texture are like those of the gazelles. He
resembles the gazelles also by the shape of his
body, the smallness of his head, the length of
his neck, the position of his eyes, ears, and
horns, and in the shape and length of the tail.
The gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences,
to whom one of these animals was presented by
the name of the <i>Barbary cow</i>, and who adopted
that denomination, did not hesitate to acknowledge
it to be the <i>bubalus</i> of the ancients.
Though we have rejected this denomination of
<i>Barbary cow</i>, as equivocal and confused, yet
as for the rest, we could not do better than copy
the exact description those gentlemen have
given of this animal, and by which we perceive
it is neither gazelle, goat, cow, elk, nor
stag, but a particular and distinct species.
This animal is also the same that Caius has described
under the name of <i>buselaphus</i>, and I
was surprised that the gentlemen of the Academy
did not make this remark, since all the
characters which Caius gives to his buselaphus
agree with their Barbary cow.</p>

<p>In the royal cabinet is, first, the skeleton of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a bubalus the gentlemen of the Academy bad
described and dissected, by the name of the
Barbary cow. Secondly, a head much larger
than that of this skeleton, the horns of which
are also much longer and thicker. Thirdly, a
part of another head, with horns as large as
the foregoing, but their form and direction are
different. There are, therefore, in the bubalus,
as well as in the gazelles, antelopes, and others,
varieties in the size of the body, and in the
shape of the horns; but these differences do
not appear to be considerable enough to make
distinct and separate species.</p>

<p>The bubalus is common in Barbary, and in
all the northern parts of Africa; he is nearly
of the same nature as the antelopes, and has,
like them, short hair, black hide, and his flesh
is good to eat.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Marigny, who embraces
every opportunity of encouraging the arts and
sciences, shewed me in his cabinet the head of
an animal, which, at first sight, I imagined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
belong to a large bubalus. It resembled those
of our largest stags; but instead of solid horns,
like those of the stag, it had two large and
hollow ones with a ridge, like those of the he-goat,
and with double flexions, like those of
the antelope. In examining the royal cabinet
for what might be relative to this animal,
we found two horns; the first without any
mark or name, came from his Majesty&rsquo;s wardrobe;
the second was given to me in 1760 by
M. Baurhis, commissary of the Marines, with
the name of <i>condoma</i> of the Cape of Good
Hope affixed to it. This name we have
adopted, as the animal which it denotes has
never before been described nor denominated.</p>

<p>By the length, thickness, and, above all,
the double flexion of the horns, the condoma
approaches very near the <i>strepsiceros</i> of
Caius; the shape and contours of the horns
are exactly the same, and from which it seems
reasonable to presume that they are the same
animal, especially if we attend to the following
reflections: first, Caius was evidently deceived
in considering this animal as the strepsiceros
of the ancients; for the strepsiceros of
the ancients is certainly the antelope, whose
head is very different from that of the stag;
while Caius affirms, that the head of his strepsiceros
is like that of the stags, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his strepsiceros is not the same as that of the
ancients. Secondly, the horns of the animal
Caius describes, are thick, more than three
feet in length, covered with rugosities, and not
with rings or tubercles; while those of the
strepsiceros of the ancients, or antelope, are
much thinner and shorter, and are furnished
with rings and tubercles. Thirdly, although
the horns of the condoma, which is in the
Marquis de Marigny&rsquo;s cabinet, as well as those
which came from the wardrobe of the king,
have been polished and used, it is, nevertheless,
plainly perceivable, that they never had
rings; this is farther demonstrated by the
horns M. Baurhis gave to me, which had
never been polished, and yet it was rough, like
the horns of the he-goat, and not annulated like
those of the antelope; besides, Caius himself
says, that the horns of his strepsiceros had only
rugosities, therefore his strepsiceros is not the
same as that of the ancients, but the animal
here spoken of, and which, in fact, is furnished
with every character Caius has given to that
which he describes.</p>

<p>In looking over the works of travellers for
those marks which might have an affinity with
the remarkable size of the horns of this animal,
we can find none that have a nearer relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to it than those of the animal mentioned
by Kolbe, under the name of the <i>wild goat</i> of
the Cape of Good Hope. &ldquo;This goat, says
he, to which the Hottentots have not as yet
given a name, and which I call the wild goat,
is remarkable in many respects; it is about the
size of a large stag; its head is very handsome,
ornamented with two smooth crooked and
pointed horns, about three feet long, and at
their extremities about two feet asunder.&rdquo;
These characters appear perfectly to agree with
the animal in question; but having seen no
more than the head, we cannot affirm that the
rest of Kolbe&rsquo;s descriptions equally agrees
with it; we, therefore, can only presume it as
a probability, which requires confirmation by
future observations. Kolbe remarks, that
&ldquo;All along the back there runs a white stripe,
which ends at the insertion of the tail; another
of the same colour crosses this at the bottom of
the neck, which it entirely surrounds; there
are two more which surround the body, the
one behind the fore legs and the other before
the hind ones. The colour of the rest of the
body is grey, with some reddish spots, except
the belly, which is white; it has also a long
grey beard, and its legs, though long, are
well proportioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Guib (<a href="#FIG_156"><i>fig. 156.</i></a>) is an animal, which,
though not noticed by any naturalist or traveller,
is very common in Senegal, from
whence M. Adanson brought over some of
their skins. It resembles the gazelles, especially
the nanguer, in the size and shape of its
body, in the fineness of its legs, in the form of
its head and muzzle, in the eyes and ears, in
the length of its tail, and by the want of a
beard but every gazelle, especially the nanguer,
has the colour of the belly white, while
the breast and belly of the guib are of a deep
brown. It also differs from the gazelles in
the horns, which are smooth, without annular
prominences, and have two longitudinal ridges,
the one above and the other underneath, forming
a spiral twist from the base to the point;
they are also a little compressed. In these
particulars the guib is more like the goat than
the gazelle, nevertheless it is neither the one
nor the other, but rather an intermediate species.
It is also remarkable for white stripes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on a brown ground, that are disposed along
and across the animal&rsquo;s body, as if it were covered
with a harness. It is a gregarious animal,
and they are found in numerous herds in
the plains of Podor.</p>

<p>This animal is only known to naturalists by
the name of <i>Grimm</i>, or the <i>Wild Goat of Grimmius</i>;
and which, as we were not acquainted
with the name it bears in its own country, we
shall adopt. We find a figure of this animal
in the German Ephemerides, which has been
copied in the Academical Collection. Dr.
Herman Grimmius was the first who mentioned
this animal, and what he said of it has been
copied by Ray, and afterwards by all the nomenclators.
Although his description<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> is incomplete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he denotes two characters so remarkable,
that we can have no doubt that the
head of an animal of Senegal, given us by M.
Adanson, belongs to the goat of Grimmius.
The first is a very deep cavity under each eye,
so deep, indeed, as to leave but a thin partition
of bone between the cavities and the partition of
their nose; the second is a tuft of hair standing
upright on the top of the head. These are
sufficient to distinguish the grimm from every
other goat or gazelle. It resembles both, however,
not only in the shape of its body, but
even in its horns, which are annulated towards
the base, and have longitudinal streaks like
those of the gazelles; at the same time, they
are very short, and bend backwards in a horizontal
direction, like the small African goat
before mentioned. Besides, from being much
smaller, and from having short horns, we are
almost led to conclude that this animal forms
the shade between the goat and small antelopes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_X_24" id="Footnote_X_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_X_24"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> This animal, on the back and neck, is of a dark ash
colour, with a white belly, and is about a foot and a half in
height; on the top of its head between the horns is a tuft of
black hair, and between each eye and the nostrils, there is a
cavity filled with a yellow humour, oily, and viscid, which
has some resemblance to castor, and musk, and fills again
upon the cavities being emptied.   <i>Grimmius.</i></p></div>

<p>There is some reason to think, that the male
grimm is alone furnished with horns; for the
individual of which Dr. Grimmius has given
the description and figure, had no horns: and
the head which M. Adanson has given us was,
on the contrary, ornamented with two, very
short, and almost concealed by the hair, but yet
sufficiently visible not to escape the notice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the observer; besides, we shall find, in the
history of the chevrotains or small antelopes,
that in the chevrotain of Guinea, the male
only has horns, whence it is presumable, that
it is the same with the grimm species, which
in every respect approaches nearer the chevrotain
than any other animal.</p>

<p>In the year 1777, M. VosmaÃ«r published a
description of this animal, which he calls the
<i>Small Beautiful Buck of Guinea</i>, and from
whom we have extracted the following account.
&ldquo;This was one of the most beautiful animals
I ever saw; it was sent from Guinea with thirteen
others of both sexes, but twelve of them
died in their voyage to Holland, and those two
which survived were males; these were put
into the menagerie of the Prince of Orange,
and one of them died the following winter,
1764. They are remarkable timid animals,
and are much frightened at any noise, especially
at thunder. When they are suddenly surprised,
they express their fear by whistling
strongly with their nose. The one now living, (in
1766) though very wild at first, is now so familiar,
that upon holding a piece of bread to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
him, and calling him by the name they have
given him of <i>tetje</i>, he will not only approach,
but allow himself to be stroaked. He is a
particularly clean animal, and will not suffer
the smallest piece of dirt to remain on any part
of his body, but is constantly scratching himself
with his hind feet. He is very active,
and when standing still, keeps one of his fore-legs
rather in a bent position, which gives him
a graceful appearance. He eats bread, rye,
carrots, is fond of potatoes, and is a ruminating
animal. His horns are rather large in proportion
to his size, and he has a small quantity
of hair between them which he rises to a point.
He is about the size of a young kid of two
months old, and his limbs are extremely well
proportioned. His head somewhat resembles
that of a roe-buck; his nose is black and
naked, but always moist; his upper lip appears
as if divided; he has no beard but a
kind of small whiskers on the sides, and a wart
covered with hair under his chin; his horns
are black, about three inches long, quite
straight, and end with a sharp point; they
are furnished with three rings, which rise a
little backward; from the black tuft between
the horns, there is a stripe of that colour down
to the nose; his ears are large, with some short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hairs on the insides, and on the tops, but all
the other parts of them are black and naked;
the eyes are large, and of a deep brown, between
the eyes and nose there are black cavities,
from the middle of which a viscid gummy
humour exudes, that soon becomes hard and
black, but I could never perceive that it contained
that odour which Dr. Grimmius and
those who have followed him, describe it to
possess; the upper part of the neck and the
head are of a yellowish grey, the back black,
the sides a bright brown, the belly grey, and
the limbs white as far as his knees; his legs
have a black band, and the hair becomes
blackish towards the hoofs; he had no heels,
his feet were cloven, he had beautiful black
pointed hoofs, and his tail was very short and
white, with a black band on the upper part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have given the name of <i>Chevrotain</i>
(<i>tragulus</i>) to the small animals of the warm
regions of Africa and Asia, which almost
every traveller has mentioned by the denomination
of the <i>little stag</i>, or <i>little hind</i>. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the chevrotain is a miniature resemblance of the
stag, from the shape of its muzzle, lightness of
its body, shortness of tail, and form of its legs;
but differs greatly in size, the largest never
exceeding that of the hare. Some of them are
entirely without horns, and those which have
any, are hollow, annulated, and nearly resemble
those of the gazelles. Their small
cloven foot, is also more like that of the gazelle
than of the stag; and they differ both
from the gazelle and the stag, by not having
any depressions or hollows under their eyes: in
that particular they approach the goat, but in
reality they are neither stags, gazelles, nor
goats, but constitute one or more distinct species.
Seba gives the figures and descriptions
of five chevrotains. The first he calls the
<i>little red Guinea kind without horns</i>; the second,
<i>the fawn</i>, <i>or the young delicate stag of
Africa</i>; the third, <i>the little young stag of Guinea</i>;
the fourth, <i>the little red and white hind of
Surinam</i>; and the fifth, <i>the red-haired African
stag</i>. Of these five chevrotains, the first,
second, and third, are evidently the same
animal; the fifth, which is larger than the
three first, and whose hair is much stronger,
and of a deep yellow, seems to be only
a variety of the first; the fourth, which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
author mentions as an animal of Surinam, appears
to be only a second variety of this species,
which is found only in Africa and the
southern parts of Asia; and I am greatly inclined
to think that Seba was misinformed,
when he says this animal came from Surinam.
Every traveller, who speaks of these little stags,
mentions them as being found in Senegal,
Guinea, and the East Indies; but not one
affirms that he has seen them in America; and
if the spotted chevrotain which Seba speaks
of, did really come from Surinam, we must
presume that it had been transported from
Guinea, or from some other southern province
of the old continent. But there appears to
be a second species of chevrotain, different from
all those we have mentioned, which seem to be
only simple varieties of the first. This second
species has small horns, not more than an inch
in length, and the same in circumference: these
horns are hollow, black, somewhat crooked,
very sharp at the points, and surrounded at the
bottom with two or three transverse rings.
We have seen the feet and one of the horns of
this animal in the royal cabinet, which sufficiently
demonstrate it is either a chevrotain or
a very small gazelle. Kolbe, speaking of this
animal, says, it has horns like those of the stag,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and that the branches were in proportion to
their age; this is an evident error, which a
single inspection of the horns will clearly
prove.</p>

<p>These animals are of an elegant make, and
their limbs finely proportioned for their size.
But though they leap and bound with prodigious
swiftness, yet, apparently, they cannot
continue it long, for the Indians often hunt
and frequently knock them down with their
sticks: they are greatly sought after on account
of the superior excellence of their flesh.</p>

<p>By comparing the different testimonies of
travellers it appears, first, that the chevrotain
without horns is peculiar to the East Indies;
secondly, that the one with horns is the chevrotain
of Senegal, and which is called <i>guevei</i> by
the natives; thirdly, that only the male <i>guevei</i>
is furnished with horns; fourthly, that the
chevrotain marked with white spots, and which
Seba says comes from Surinam, is, on the contrary,
a native of the East Indies, especially of
Ceylon, where it is called <i>memina</i>, (<a href="#FIG_158"><i>fig. 158.</i></a>)
and we must therefore, conclude, that there
are but two kinds of chevrotains, namely, the
<i>memina</i>, (<a href="#FIG_157"><i>fig. 157.</i></a>) or the Indian chevrotain
without horns; and the <i>guevei</i>, or Guinea
chevrotain with horns; that the five species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
spoken of by Seba are only varieties of the memina;
and that the smallest kind, which in
Senegal is called <i>guevei-kaior</i>, is only a variety
of the guevei.</p>

<p>These little animals can only live in excessive
hot climates; they are so exceedingly
delicate that it is with the greatest difficulty
they are transported into Europe alive, where
they perish in a short time. They are gentle,
familiar, and very beautiful. They are, unquestionably,
the smallest of all cloven-footed
animals. According to this character of being
cloven footed, they should not bring forth
many young; but if we reason from their small
size they should produce several at a litter.
As to the fact on this point we must wait until
opportunity is procured to make the observation;
we are inclined to think they bring forth
but one or two at a time, like the gazelles, roe-bucks,
&amp;c. but possibly they produce more
frequently, for they are exceedingly numerous
in India, Java, Ceylon, Senegal, Congo, and
in every other country that is excessively hot,
but are not to be found in America, nor in any
of the temperate climates of the old continent.</p>

<p>Mazame, in the Mexican language, was
the name of the stag, or rather a generic name,
including the whole race of stags, fallow-deer,
and roe-bucks. Hernandes, Recchi, and
Fernandes, who have transmitted this name to
us, distinguish two species of mazames, both
common in Mexico and New Spain. The
first and largest, to which they give the simple
name of <i>mazame</i>, has horns like those of the
roe-buck of Europe, that is, about six or seven
inches in length, with the extremities divided
into two points, and a single antler. The
second, called <i>temamaÃ§ame</i>, is much less, and
has but a single horn, and without any antlers.
These two animals seem to be roe-bucks, the
first being the same species as the European
roe-buck, and the second only a variety of it.
It also appears, that these mazames and temamaÃ§ames
of Mexico are the same as the <i>cuguacu-apara</i>,
and the <i>cuguacu-Ã©tÃ©</i> of Brasil, and that
in Cayenne the first is called <i>cariacou</i>, (<a href="#FIG_157"><i>fig. 157.</i></a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
or the forest hind; the second, <i>the small cariacou</i>,
or <i>the hind of the marshes</i>. Though we
are the first who have pointed out these relations,
yet we should not have presumed that
there were either difficulties or doubts on this
subject, if Seba had not mentioned the mazame
and the temamaÃ§ame as two different
animals: they are not roe-bucks with solid
and branched horns, but gazelles with hollow
and wrinkled ones: they are not animals of
New Spain, as this author describes them, but
natives of Africa. These errors of Seba have
been adopted by most authors who have written
since. They have not suspected that the animals
mentioned by Seba, under the names of
mazame and temamaÃ§ame, were the same as
those mentioned by Hernandes, Recchi, and
Fernandes. The confusion of the names has
been followed by a confusion of the animals,
and, in consequence, some naturalists have indicated
these animals by the name of chevrotains,
and others by that of gazelles, or goats.
It appears that LinnÃ¦us suspected this error,
for he has not adopted it. He has placed
the mazame in the list of stags, and has
thought, as we do, that the Mexican mazame
is the same animal as the cuguacu of
Brasil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>To demonstrate what we have advanced, we
will suppose that there were neither gazelles,
nor chevrotains, in New Spain, or in any other
part of America, and that all those, as well as
goats, which are at present there, have been
carried from the old continent; that the true
mazame of Mexico is the same animal as the
cuguacu-apara of Brasil; that the name <i>cuguacu</i>
is pronounced <i>couguacou</i>; and that, by
corruption, this animal is called <i>cariacou</i> at
Cayenne, from whence we had a living one
sent us by this name of <i>cariacou</i>. We shall
now endeavour to find out what species of animals
these may be to which Seba has applied
the names mazame and temamaÃ§ame, for to
destroy an error it is not sufficient to reject it,
but we should also explain the cause and demonstrate
the effects.</p>

<p>The gazelles and chevrotains inhabit only
the hottest countries of the Old World; they
cannot exist in temperate climates, and still
less in those that are cold. They could not,
therefore, have ever frequented the northern
countries, and have passed, by that means, from
one continent to the other; nor have any travellers
or historians of the New World, ever
pretended to have seen them in that part of the
globe. On the contrary, stags and roe-bucks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which inhabit cold and temperate climates,
might have passed over the northern lands, and
therefore are met with in both continents.
We have observed, in our history of the
stag, that the Cardian stag is the same as that
of Europe; that he is only smaller, and
has some slight variations in the shape of
his horns and the colour of his hair. We
may add, to what has been already said, that
in America there are as many varieties among
stags as in Europe, notwithstanding which they
are of the same species. One of these varieties
is the Corsican stag, which is smaller and
browner than the common kind. We have
also mentioned white stags, and hinds, and
have said, that this colour proceeds from their
domestic state; this kind is also found in America,
as well as our common and small brown
stags. The Mexicans, who keep these white
stags in their parks, have denominated them
<i>Royal Stags</i>. It is a native of Germany, and
commonly called the <i>Stag of Ardennes</i>; and
<i>Brandhirts</i>, by the Germans: it is at least
as big as the large French stags, but differs
from them by several particular characters.
Its coat is thicker, and of a lighter colour under
its belly: its throat and neck is furnished
with long hairs, like the he-goat, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
caused both ancients and moderns to give it the
name of <i>tragelaphus</i>, or <i>stag-like goat</i>. There
are also a great number of roe-bucks in America:
we are only acquainted with two varieties
in Europe, the red and the brown; the latter
are smaller than the former, but they perfectly
resemble each other. The mazame of
Mexico, the cuguacu-apara of Brasil, and the
cariacou, or forest hind of Cayenne, entirely
resemble our red roe-bucks. Comparing the
descriptions given of them is a sufficient proof,
that all these names denote the same animal.
But the temamaÃ§ame, which we suppose to be
the cuguacu-Ã©tÃ© of Brasil, the small cariacou
of Cayenne may be a variety different from
those of Europe. The temamaÃ§ame is less,
and whiter on the belly than the mazame, in
the same manner as our brown roe-buck has a
whiter belly, and is smaller than our red one;
it seems also to differ by the horns, which is
single and without antlers in the figure given
by Recchi; but if we consider that our roe-bucks,
and stags, have no antlers in the first,
and sometimes even in the second year of their
age, we shall be inclined to think, that Recchi&rsquo;s
temamaÃ§ame was too young to have antlers:
these two animals, therefore, appear to be only
simple varieties in the roe-buck species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>It now remains to enquire what these two
animals, mentioned by Seba, by the false names
of <i>mazame</i> and <i>temamaÃ§ame</i> really are. The
bare inspection of the figures, independently
of his description, demonstrates, that these
animals belong to the goats or gazelles, and
not to the stags or roe-bucks. The want of
a beard, and the shape of the horns, prove,
they are not goats, but gazelles; and, by comparing
Seba&rsquo;s figures with the gazelles which
we have described, I found that his pretended
<i>temamaÃ§ame of New Spain</i>, is the <i>kob</i>, or
<i>little brown cow of Senegal</i>. The figure, colour,
and size of the horns are the same; the
colour of the hair is also the same, and differs
from that of other gazelles, by not being white,
but yellow under the belly and upon the
flanks. With respect to the pretended mazame,
although it resembles the gazelles in
general, yet it differs in particular from all
those we have before enumerated; but we saw
in M. Adanson&rsquo;s cabinet, where he has collected
the most rare productions of Senegal, a stupid
animal which we call <i>nagor</i>, by reason of
the resemblance of its horns with those of the
nanguer. This animal is found in the neighbouring
island of Goree, from whence he was
sent to M. Adanson by M. Andriot, and possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
all the characters which Seba gives to
his pretended mazame; its body is of a pale
red, and its belly is not white, like the other
gazelles; it is of the size of the roe-buck; its
horns are not six inches long, almost smooth,
and slightly bent forwards, but not so much as
those of the nanguer. Therefore this animal,
mentioned by Seba, by the name of <i>mazame</i>,
or <i>American stag</i>, is only an African goat, or
gazelle, which we have added here by the
name of the <i>nagor</i> to the twelve other gazelles,
whose history we have already given.</p>

<p>The class of ruminating animals is, of all
others, the most numerous and the most varied.
It contains, as we have seen, a great number
of species, and, perhaps, a still greater number
of distinct races, or constant varieties. Notwithstanding
all our enquiries, and the considerable
details into which we have been obliged
to enter, we freely confess, that we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
not exhausted the subject, and that there still
remain even very remarkable animals which
we are only acquainted with by imperfect fragments,
and are unable to ascertain with precision
to what class they belong. For example,
in the very great collection of horns in the
royal cabinet, as well as those dispersed in
private museums, each of which, after much
labour, and a multiplicity of comparisons, we
have referred to the animal it belonged; there
still remained one without label, or any mark
affixed to it, absolutely unknown. This horn
is large, almost straight, and composed of a
very thick black substance; it is not solid, like
that of the stag, but resembles that of the ox.
From the base to beyond the middle of the
horn is a thick ridge, raised about an inch;
and although the horn is straight, this prominent
ridge makes a spiral turn and a half in
the interior part, and is wholly effaced in the
superior part of the horn, which terminates in
a point. This horn, which differs from every
other, seems to have the nearest affinity to that
of the buffalo; but we were ignorant of the
name of the animal to which it belonged, and
it was not till hunting through the different
cabinets that we found in that of M. Dupleix
part of a head adorned with two similar horns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and to which was affixed a label with these
words: &ldquo;<i>the horns of an animal nearly like a
horse, of a greyish colour; with a mane on the
fore part of its head like a horse; it is called at
Pondicherry</i> coÃ«sdoÃ«s, <i>which should be pronounced</i>
coudous.&rdquo; This little discovery gave
me great pleasure; but I have not been able
to meet with this name <i>coÃ«sdoÃ«s</i>, or <i>coudous</i>,
in the writings of any traveller; the label only
has informed us that it is of a large size, and
to be met with in the hottest countries of Asia.
The buffalo is of the same climate, and has
likewise a mane; it is true his horns are
crooked and flat, while those of the coudous
are round and straight, which, together with
the colour, are sufficient indications of the
difference of these two animals; for the buffalo
has a black skin and hair, and, according to the
label, the hair of the other is grey. These relations
suggest others: the travellers in Asia
speak of the large buffaloes of Bengal, of red
buffaloes, and of the grey buffaloes of the
Mogul empire, which are called <i>nil-gauts</i>;
the coudous may possibly be one or other of
these animals, and the travellers into Africa,
where the buffalo is as common as in Asia,
more precisely mention a species of buffalo,
called <i>pacassa</i> at Congo, which from their indications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
seems to be the coudous. &ldquo;In the route
from Louanda to the kingdom of Congo<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>, we
perceived two pacassas, which are animals resembling
buffaloes, and which roar like lions.
The male and female go always together; they
are white, spotted with red and black; their
ears are about half an ell long, and their horns
are perfectly straight: they neither fly at the
sight of the human species nor do any injury,
but only stare at them as they pass along."
We have before mentioned, that the animal,
called at Congo, empacassa, or pacassa, appeared
to be the buffalo. It is, in fact, a
kind of buffalo, but differs from it by the shape
of the horns and the colour of the hair; in
one word, the pacassa is the coudous, which
perhaps forms a separate species from that of
the buffalo, and perhaps, also, may only be a
variety of it<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_Z_26" id="Footnote_Z_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Z_26"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> The coudous is from five to eight feet in height. The

head is reddish; the tail is black at its extremity, and terminated
by a little tuft. Both sexes have horns. They are
of a deep black colour, and two feet in length. The Hotentots
make tobacco pipes of them. Their flesh is excellent.</p>

<p>To finish the history of goats, gazelles,
chevrotains, and other animals of this genus,
which are all found in the old continent, it only
remains to give that of the Musk, an animal
as famous as it is unknown. This is the animal
which produces the real musk; all modern
naturalists, and the greatest part of travellers
through Asia, have mentioned it, some by the
name of a stag, a roe-buck, or a musk-goat,
and others have considered it as a large chevrotain.
It seems indeed to be of an ambiguous
nature, participating of all the above animals,
yet at the same time we can assert, that its species
is different from all other quadrupeds. It
is about the size of a small roe-buck, but its
head is without horns, and by this character it
resembles the <i>memina</i> or <i>chevrotain</i> of India.
It has two great canine teeth or tusks in the
upper jaw, and by this it approaches the <i>chevrotain</i>
of India; but what distinguishes the
musk from all other animals is a kind of bag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
about two or three inches in diameter, which
grows near the navel, and in which the liquor,
or rather the greasy humour called musk is secreted,
and which differs from that of the civet
both in smell and consistence. Neither the
Greeks nor Romans mention the musk animal.
The first that noticed it were the Arabs. Gesner,
Aldrovandus, Kircher, and Boym have
given more extended accounts of this animal;
but Grew is the only person who has made an
exact description of it, from a skin which was
preserved in the cabinet of the Royal Society of
London. His description is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
musk stag is about three feet six inches
in length, from the head to the tail; the head
is about half a foot long; the neck seven or
eight inches; the fore part of the head three
inches broad, and the nose sharp like that of a
greyhound; the ears are erect, like those of a
rabbit, and about three inches long; the tail
is not above two inches; the fore-legs, including
feet and thighs, are thirteen or fourteen
inches long; he is cloven-footed, armed on his
fore-feet behind and before with two horny
substances: the hind feet were wanting. The
hair of the head and legs about half an inch
long, and very fine; thicker under the belly,
and an inch and a half in length; on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
back and crupper they are three inches, and
three or four times thicker than the bristles of
a hog, of course more so than that of any other
animal. It is brown and white alternately,
from the root to the point; on the head and
thighs it is brown; under the belly and tail
white; a little curled, especially on the back
and belly; it is very soft, and has the appearance
of being something between a common
hair and a quill; on each side of the lower jaw,
under the corners of the mouth, there is a small
tuft of thick hair, which is short and hard, about
three-fourths of an inch long, and somewhat
resembling the bristles of a hog. The bladder,
or bag, which contains the musk is about three
inches long, two broad, swells out from the
belly about an inch and a half, and stands near
as much before the groin. The animal has
twenty-six teeth, sixteen in the lower jaw, of
which the eight in front are incisive, the
four grinders behind, are rugged and continuous,
and as many similar grinders in the
upper jaw. There is also a tusk about two
inches and a half long on each side in the upper
jaw, which terminate in the form of a hook,
not round but flat, and have a sharp edge behind.
They have no horns, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AA_27" id="Footnote_AA_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AA_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> Grew&rsquo;s Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In 1681, a year after Grew&rsquo;s publication,
Luc Schrockius printed a history of this animal
at Vienna, in which we do not find any
thing very exact, nor absolutely new. We
shall, however, select such facts as may be
collected from it, and which agree with those
in other authors, and especially in the works
of the more modern travellers. We have been
under the necessity of contenting ourselves with
collecting what has been said of this animal,
which we have never seen, and which we have
not been able to procure. By Grew&rsquo;s description,
which is the only authentic work we can
rely on, it appears, that the hair of this animal
is long and rough, the muzzle pointed, and the
tusks somewhat like those of the hog: in these
characters it approaches the boar kind, or perhaps
still more the babiroussa, which the naturalists
have denominated the <i>Indian boar</i>;
and which, though resembling the hog in
many characters, like the musk animal, he is
much smaller, and has longer and slender legs,
like those of the stag, or roe-buck. On the
other hand, the American hog, which we have
called <i>pecari</i>, has a bag, or cavity, on its
back, containing an odoriferous humour. The
musk animal has a similar bag, not on his
back, but under the belly. In general, those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
animals which produce odoriferous liquors, as
the badger, the bearer, the pecari, the musk-rat,
the civet, the zibet, are not of the stag or
goat genus: thus we might be tempted to
think, that the musk animal is nearer the hog
kind, of which he has the tusks, if he had, at the
same time, incisive teeth in his upper jaw; but
his deficiency in that respect, makes him come
nearer the ruminating animals, and especially
the chevrotain, which ruminates, though it has
no horns; but all these external indexes can
only furnish us with conjectures. It is the inspection
of the internal parts alone that can
decide the nature of this animal, which is not
even as yet perfectly known; nor have I
placed him after the goats and antelopes from
any conviction or even reason to conclude he
belongs to those species.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, Barbosa, Thevenot, and Marini,
are all more or less deceived in the characters
they have given of this animal<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a>. The
only true point in which they agree is, that
the musk is formed in a bag, or tumour, near
the navel, and it appears by their testimonies,
as well as those of other travellers, that the
male only produces the musk; that the female
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
has a similar bag near the navel, but that the
humour which gathers there, has not the same
smell; that this tumour of the male is only
filled with musk at the rutting-time, and that
at other times the quantity of this humour is
less, and the odoriferous scent much weaker.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AB_28" id="Footnote_AB_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AB_28"><span class="label">[AB]</span></a> There exists in fact, says Sonnini, a variety of the
musk animal which is entirely white. It is however very
rare. Pallas saw a female of this variety which came from
the country of the Abakanks. <i>See Pallas, vol. iv. p. 14.</i></p></div>

<p>In respect to the musk itself, its essence, or
pure substance, is, perhaps, as little known as
the nature of the animal which produces it.
All travellers agree, that the musk is always
mixed and adulterated with blood, or some
other drugs, by those who sell it. The Chinese
not only increase the quantity by this mixture,
but they endeavour likewise to increase the
weight, by incorporating with it lead very
finely ground. The purest musk, and that
which is the most sought after, even by the
Chinese themselves, is that which the animal
deposits upon trees or stones, against which
he rubs himself when the quantity becomes too
great, or renders the pouch uneasy. That
which is found in the bag is seldom so good,
because it is not fully ripe, or because perhaps
it is only in their rutting season that it acquires
all its strength and smell; and that it is at this
time the animal endeavours to disburthen
himself of a matter which then causes violent
itchings, and possibly some degree of pain.</p>

<p>Chardin and Tavernier have both described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the means, which the eastern nations make use
of to adulterate the musk<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a>: the merchants must
necessarily increase the quantity of it beyond
conception, since in one year Tavernier purchased
1673 bags, which supposes an equal
number of animals to have been taken. But
as this animal is no where domestic, and as the
species is confined to some few provinces of the
East, it is impossible to be sufficiently numerous
to produce so great a quantity of this
matter. We cannot, therefore, doubt the
greatest part of these pretended bags, or bladders,
are only artificial ones made of the skin
of the other parts of the animal, and filled with
its blood, mixed with a very small quantity of
true musk. Its scent is, in fact, the strongest
of any yet known; a single grain is sufficient
to perfume a great quantity of other matter;
the odour of the smallest particle will perfume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a considerable space; and the perfume
itself is so permanent, that at the end of several
years it does not seem to have lost much of
its power.<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AC_29" id="Footnote_AC_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AC_29"><span class="label">[AC]</span></a> It is said that when the animal is taken, and the musk
bag first opened, that the odour is so strong the hunter is
obliged to have several folds of linen over his nose and mouth,
and that even then it sometimes proves fatal. I am inclined
to believe this is true: because the musk decreases in strength
with time, and when I dealt in that article, I always found
it requisite to stand in the open air, and at a distance from
those who moved the bladders. This drug is, however, very
frequently adulterated by the hunters with the blood of the
animal, and by the merchants with the blood of oxen, lead,
&amp;c. But the natives of India have various methods of detecting
this adulteration, they discover it by the taste, and
weight, but mostly with a thread steeped in the juice of
garlic which they draw through the bag with a needle, and
if it retains that smell they are certain of its being adulterated.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AD_30" id="Footnote_AD_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AD_30"><span class="label">[AD]</span></a> The musk is a solitary animal, which prefers high
mountains and rugged rocks; sometimes he descends into
the profound and dark chasms which separate the highest
chains of mountains, and sometimes he climbs to their tops
covered with snow. He is very agile, and swims very well;
extremely ferocious, it is difficult to approach him, and
equally so to tame him, though mildness forms the basis of
his character. He is in rut in the months of November and
December; this season of love is also the season of furious
combats between the males. They eat the flesh of this animal:
but that of the young ones alone is good and tender.</p></div>

<p>Although we have only the head of
this animal in the royal cabinet, it is too remarkable
to be passed over in silence. All naturalists
have looked upon it as a kind of hog,
though either its head, size, bristles, nor tail,
resemble that animal: its legs are longer, and
its muzzle shorter; it is covered with short
hair, as soft as wool, and its tail is terminated
by a tuft of this wool; its body is likewise not
so thick and clumsy as that of the hog; its
hair is grey, mixed with red and a little black;
its ears are short and pointed; but the most
remarkable character, and which distinguishes
it from all other animals, are four enormous
tusks, or canine teeth, the two shortest of
which shoot out of the lower jaw, like those of
the wild boar, and the two others, which come
from the upper jaw, pierce the checks, or rather
the upper part of the lips, and rise in a
curve almost to the eyes. The tusks are a
very beautiful ivory, much smoother and finer,
but not so hard as that of the elephant.</p>

<p>The position and the direction of these two
upper tusks, which rise upright, and then bend
in the form of a circle, have made some skilful
naturalists, such as Grew, imagine that these
tusks ought not to be looked upon as teeth, but
as horns. They founded their opinion upon
the circumstance that in all animals the sockets
of the teeth in the upper jaw open downwards;
that in the babiroussa, as in the other animals,
the sockets are turned downwards, except
those of these two great tusks, which, on
the contrary, are turned upwards; and they
concluded from thence, that from this essential
character of the upper teeth, these tusks,
whose sockets are directed upwards, ought to
be looked upon as horns and not as teeth.
But these philosophers were deceived; the
position or direction is only a circumstance,
and not essential to the existence of an object.
These tusks, though situate in an opposite manner
to that of the other teeth, is only a singularity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the direction, which cannot change
the nature of the thing, nor make an ivory horn
of a true canine tooth.</p>

<p>These enormous tusks give this animal a very
formidable appearance; they are, however, less
dangerous than our wild boars. They go in
herds, and have a very strong smell, by which
they are easily discovered, and are hunted by
dogs with good success. They growl terribly,
defend themselves, and wound their enemies
with their under tusks; for the upper are rather
of disservice than of use to them. Although
savage and ferocious, they are tamed with
great ease; and their flesh, which is very good,
putrifies in a short time. As their hair is fine,
and their skin delicate, it is soon penetrated by
the teeth of dogs, who hunt them in preference
to wild boars, and sooner accomplish their
purpose. They fasten their upper tusks in the
branches of trees, to rest their heads, or to sleep
standing. This habit they have in common
with the elephant, who, in order to sleep in a
standing posture, supports his head by fixing
the end of his tusks in the holes which he
makes in the walls of his lodging.</p>

<p>The babiroussa differs still more from the
wild boar, by his natural appetites; he feeds
upon grass and leaves of trees, and does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
endeavour to enter gardens to feed on beans,
pease, and other vegetables; while the wild
boar, who lives in the same country, feeds upon
wild fruit, roots, and often destroys the gardens.
Besides, these animals who go together
in herds, never intermix; the wild boars keep
on one side, and the babiroussas on the other.
The latter walk quicker and have a very fine
smell, and often stand erect against the trees
to scent the approach of dogs or hunters.
When they are pursued to any great distance
they make towards the sea, and, swimming
with great dexterity, very often escape their
pursuers, for they swim for a long time, and
often to very great distances, and from one
island to another.</p>

<p>The babiroussa is found not only in the island
of Bouro, or Boero, near Amboyna, but also
in many parts of the South of Asia, and Africa;
as at Celebes, Estrila, Senegal, and Madagascar,
for it appears that the wild boars of this island,
which Flaccourt speaks of, and says, <i>that the
males chiefly have two horns on the side of their
nose</i>, are babiroussas. We have not had it in
our power to determine whether the female has
the two tusks which are so remarkable in the
male, but most authors seem to agree that they
have.</p>

<p>Having been favoured with two drawings
of this animal, we are now enabled to present
a figure of the Babiroussa, (<a href="#FIG_160"><i>fig. 160.</i></a>) and
which we believe will give a tolerable idea of
him, since it was taken with much care, and is
a combination of both; the one of them we
received from M. Sonnerat, which represented
him in a standing posture, and the other lying
on its belly, was sent us from England by Mr.
Pennant, with the following label; &ldquo;a Babiroussa
from the island of Banda, drawn from
nature;&rdquo; it is of a blackish colour, grows to
the size of a large hog, and its flesh is very
good to eat.</p>

<p>This American animal had never been
seen in Europe until the Duke of Bouillon
procured one to be sent to him from America.
As this prince is curious in foreign animals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
he has often done me the honour of inviting
me to see them; and he has even given me
several species for the advantage of this work.
This animal (<a href="#FIG_161"><i>fig. 161.</i></a>) was sent very young
to him, and had not arrived at its full growth
when the cold killed it. It is not a hog, as
naturalists and travellers have pretended; it
only resembles that animal by trifling marks,
and differs from it by striking characters. The
largest cabiai is scarcely as big as a hog of
eighteen months growth. The head is shorter,
and its mouth less; the eyes are larger, the
number and form of the teeth are different, it
wants a tail, and is web-footed; the hoofs before
are divided into four parts, and those behind
into three; between the divisions there is
a prolongation of the skin, so that the feet,
when opened in swimming, can beat a greater
surface of water in which it frequently lives;
it swims like an otter, seeks the same prey,
and seizes the fish with its feet and teeth, and
carries them to the banks to eat. It also eats
fruits, corn, and sugar-canes. As its feet are
broad and flat it often sits upon its hind ones.
Its cry more resembles the braying of an ass
than the grunting of a hog. It seldom stirs
out but at night, and almost always in company
without going far from the sides of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
water. It can find no safety by flight, from the
length of its feet and the shortness of its legs.
To escape its enemies it plunges into the water,
and remains at the bottom so long that the
hunters lose all hopes of seeing it again. It is
fat, and the flesh is tender, but, like that of the
badger, it tastes more like bad fish than good
flesh; the head, however, is not bad, and this
agrees with what is said of the badger, his fore
parts are pretty good, while his hind ones taste
like fish.</p>

<p>The cabiai is quiet and gentle; it is neither
quarrelsome nor savage with other animals.
It is easily tamed, comes at call, and willingly
follows those who feed and treat it with kindness.
It was fed at Paris with barley, sallad,
and fruit, and was healthy while the weather
kept warm. By its number of paps we should
suppose that the females produce several young
at a litter. We do not know how long they
go with young, the time of their growth, nor,
consequently, their length of life. The natives,
or colonists, of Cayenne might inform
us of these particulars, for it is very common
in Guiana, as well as in Brasil, in Amazonia,
and in all the lower countries of South America.</p>

</div>


<p>We have been informed by M. de la Borde,
that the Cabiai is a common animal in Guiana,
and on the borders of the Amazon river; he
says that the male and female always go together;
that they avoid the habitations of men,
and always live by the sides of rivers, into
which they go whenever they are disturbed,
swimming like hogs to a great distance, sometimes
diving to the bottom, where they will
remain a considerable time; that the natives
frequently take them when very young, and
bring them up in their houses, where they soon
become familiar, and will eat bread, millet, and
herbs, although they principally live on fish
when in their wild state; that the females
produce but one at a time; that they are perfectly
harmless; and that their flesh is white
and well tasted. Although this last fact may
seem to contradict what we have formerly
stated upon the authority of other authors yet
it is by no means improbable that their flesh
may be bad when in their wild state, from feeding
on fish, and yet very good when they live
on bread and grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>As one of these animals lived some time in
Paris I am of opinion they would propagate in
our climate; and the more especially as I find
the one I formerly alluded to was not killed by
the cold, but that the winter had no particular
effect upon it. I have since been informed
that this animal, was confined in an upper
room, from the window of which it jumped,
and falling into a vessel of water was drowned.</p>

<p>The name given this animal leads to a
supposition that it is a hog covered with thorny
quills,<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> when, in fact, it only resembles that
animal by its grunting; in every other respect
it differs from the hog as much as any other
animal, both in its outward appearance and inferior
conformation. Instead of a long head
and ears, armed with tusks, and terminated
with a snout; instead of cloven feet, furnished
with hoofs like the hog; the porcupine has a
short head like the beaver, two large incisive
teeth in each jaw, no tusks or canine teeth,
the upper lip divided like that of the hare, the
ears round and flat, and the feet armed with
claws. Instead of a large stomach, with an
appendix in form of a cowl, the porcupine has
only a single stomach, with a large cÃ¦cum
gut. The parts of generation are not apparent,
as in the boar, and its testicles are concealed
in the groin. By all these marks, together
with its short tail, long whiskers, and
divided lip it approaches more to the hare or
beaver than to the hog. The hedge-hog, indeed,
who, like the porcupine, is covered with
prickles, somewhat resembles the hog, for it
has a long muzzle, terminated by a kind of
snout; but all these resemblances being so very
slight it is clear that the porcupine (<a href="#FIG_162"><i>fig. 162.</i></a>)
is a particular and different species from the
hedge-hog, the beaver, the hare, or any other
animal whatever.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AE_31" id="Footnote_AE_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AE_31"><span class="label">[AE]</span></a> This may be said of it in reference to its French, Italian,
and Spanish appellation, but not in regard to its English one.
In German too, its name conveys this idea; <i>stachet-schwein</i> literally
<i>swine with thorns</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AF_32" id="Footnote_AF_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AF_32"><span class="label">[AF]</span></a> It is probable that the resemblance of the flesh of this
animal with that of the hog has contributed more to his
having the name which he bears, than any supposed exterior
or interior affinities between them.</p></div>

<p>Travellers and naturalists have almost unanimously
declared this animal has the faculty of
discharging its quills, and with such force as to
wound its foes at a great distance; and that
these prickly quills have the extraordinary property
of penetrating farther into the flesh of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
their own accord and power, as soon as the
point has made an entrance. This last circumstance
is purely imaginary, without any foundation,
and the first is as false as the second.
The error seems to have arisen from this animal
raising his prickles upright when he is
irritated; and as some of them are only inserted
into the skin by a small pellicle they
easily fall off. We have had many living porcupines,
but never saw them dart any of their
quills, even though violently agitated. It is
a matter of astonishment, therefore, that the
gravest authors, both ancient and modern, as
well as the most sensible travellers, should join
in opinion respecting a circumstance so entirely
false. Some affirm that they have been
wounded by this sort of darting; others, assert
that the quills are darted with such vengeance,
as to pierce a plank at a great distance.
The marvellous commonly is pleasingly believed,
and increases in proportion to the number
of hands it passes through. Truth, on the
contrary, diminishes in the same degree; and
in spite of the positive negative which I have
placed on these two fictions, I am persuaded,
that many future writers will assert that the
porcupine darts his quills to a distance, and
that when those quills are separated from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
body of the animal, they will of themselves,
and with their own exertions, penetrate deeper
into those bodies in which the point has
entered.</p>

<p>However, in justice to Dr. Shaw, we must
except him from the number of these credulous
travellers; &ldquo;Of all the number of porcupines
(says he) which I have seen in Africa,
I have never yet met with one, who could
dart their quills, however strongly he was
irritated; their common method of defence is
to lie on one side, and when the enemy approaches
very near, to rise suddenly and
wound him with the points of the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The porcupine, although originally a native
of the hottest climates of Africa and India,
lives and multiplies in colder countries, such
as Persia, Spain, and Italy. Agricola says, that
the porcupine had not been transported into
Europe, much before his time. They are
found in Spain, but more commonly in Italy,
especially on the Appenine mountains, in the
environs of Rome.</p>

<p>Pliny, and other naturalists, have said, after
Aristotle, that the porcupine, like the bear,
conceals himself during winter, and that they
bring forth in thirty days. We have not had
it in our power to verify these facts; and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
singular, that in Italy where this animal is
common, and where there has ever been skilful
philosophers and excellent observers of nature,
that its history has never been written
by any of them. Aldrovandus in speaking
on this subject, has, like the rest, only copied
Gesner; and the gentlemen of the academy,
who have dissected eight of these animals, say
very little that has any relation to their natural
habits. We only learn from the testimonies of
travellers, and persons who have kept them in
menageries, that the porcupine in its domestic
state, is neither savage nor furious, but only
anxious for liberty; that with the assistance of
its fore teeth, which are sharp and strong like
those of the beaver, he easily cuts through his
wooden prison. It is also known that he feeds
willingly on fruits, cheese, and crumbs of bread;
that in his wild state, he lives upon roots and
wild grain; that when he can enter a garden
he makes great havock<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a>, eating the herbs,
roots, fruit, &amp;c. that he becomes fat, like
most other animals, toward the end of summer;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and that the flesh of this animal, although
a little insipid, is tolerable eating.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AG_33" id="Footnote_AG_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AG_33"><span class="label">[AG]</span></a> The porcupine is a perfect scourge to the gardens of
the Cape of Good Hope; he commits great ravages in the
plantations of cabbage, and other kitchen herbs. The wild
herb of which this animal is most fond, is the <i>Calla Ethiopica</i>,
which however, is so acrid, according to Sparrman, that the root
or the leaves applied to any part of the body will raise
a blister.</p></div>

<p>When the form, substance, and organization
of the prickles of the porcupine are considered,
they are found to be tubes to which only
vanes are wanting to make them real feathers.
They strike together and make a noise as the
animal walks; he can easily erect them in the
same manner as the peacock spreads the feathers
of his tail, and as easily smooths them
again by the contraction of the cuticular muscle.
This muscle, therefore, has the same
power, and is nearly of the same formation in
the porcupine as in some birds.</p>

<p>In every article we have to treat of we
always meet with more errors to confute than
facts to relate. This arises from the history
of animals having been only written of late
by prejudiced persons, who take the list of their
little systems for the genuine register of Nature.
There are not any animals of the warm
climates of the old continent existing in America,
and reciprocally there are not any of the
South American animals to be met with under
the torrid zone of Africa and Asia. The porcupine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
as already observed, is a native of the
hot countries of the old world, and having
never been found in the new, they have not
hesitated to give his name to animals which
seemed to resemble him, and particularly to
that which we have now under consideration.
On the other hand, the Coendou (<a href="#FIG_163"><i>fig. 163.</i></a>)
of America has been transported to the East
Indies; and Piso, who probably was not acquainted
with the porcupine, has made Bontius,
who only speaks of animals in the southern
parts of Asia, engrave the coendou of America
under the name and description of the true
porcupine; so that, at the first view, we should
firmly believe, that this animal existed equally
in America and in Asia. It is easy, however,
to discover, with a little attention, that Piso,
who is in this, as well as in most parts of his
work, only a plagiarist of Marcgrave, has
not only copied his figure of the coendou,
into his history of Brasil, but has copied it
again for the work of Bontius, of which he
was the editor. Therefore, though we find
the figure of the coendou in Bontius, we must
not conclude, that it exists in Java, or in
any other part of the East Indies, nor take
this figure for that of the porcupine, which,
in fact, the coendou only resembles by its
quills or prickles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to Ximenes, and afterwards to Hernandes,
that we owe the first knowledge of
this animal, which they have indicated under
the Mexican name of <i>hoitztlacuatzin</i>. The
<i>tlacuatzin</i> is the opossum and the <i>hoitztlacuatzin</i>
should be translated the <i>bristly</i> or
<i>spinous opossum</i>. This name has been misapplied,
for these animals resemble each other
very little. Marcgrave has not adopted this
Mexican denomination, but calls this animal
<i>cuandu</i>. The only thing we can reproach
Marcgrave with, is his not having known,
that the cuandu of Brasil was the same animal
as the hoitztlacuatzin of Mexico, especially
as his description and figure agree with those
of Hernandes; and as LaÃ«t, the editor and
commentator of Marcgrave expressly says,
that the spiny tlacuatzin of Ximenes, and the
cuandu, are probably the same animal. By
collecting the scattered accounts of travellers
there appears to be two varieties of these animals,
which the naturalists, after Piso, have
inserted in their lists as two different species,
namely, the great and the little coendou: but
what immediately proves the error, or negligence
of Piso, is, that although he describes
these coendous in two separate and distinct
articles, and seems to look on them as different
species, he represents both by the same figure:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
which, we think, sufficient foundation to pronounce
them the same animal. There are
likewise other naturalists who have not only made
two species of the great and little coendou
but have also separated the hoitztlacuatzin,
and given all three as different animals. I
own, indeed, that although it is probable, the
coendou and the hoitztlacuatzin are the same
animal, yet this identity is not so certain as
that of the great and little coendou.</p>

<p>However that may be, the coendou is not
the porcupine. He is much smaller; his head
and muzzle shorter; he has no tuft on its head
nor is his upper lip divided; his quills are
proportionally shorter and much finer; his
tail is long, and that of the porcupine very
short: he is carnivorous rather than frugivorous,
and endeavours to surprize birds, small
animals, and poultry, while the porcupine only
feeds upon herbs, roots, and fruits. He sleeps
all the day like the hedge-hog, and only stirs
out in the night: he climbs up trees, and
hangs on branches by his tail. All travellers
agree, that his flesh is very good eating. He
is easily tamed, and commonly lives in high
places. These animals are found over all
America, from Brasil and Guiana, to Louisiana
and the southern parts of Canada; while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the porcupine is only to be found in the hottest
parts of the Old Continent.</p>

<p>By conferring the name of porcupine on the
coendou, the same faculties have been attributed
to him, especially that of shooting his
quills. It is astonishing that naturalists and
travellers should agree on this circumstance,
and that Piso, who ought to have been less
superstitious, as he was a physician, should
gravely assert, that the quills of the coendou
pierce into the flesh by their own power, and
penetrate into the body even to the most internal
viscera. Ray is the only person who
has denied these circumstances, although they
evidently appear to be absurd. How many
absurdities have been exposed by men of sense,
which, nevertheless, are affirmed by other men
who think they are endowed with a greater
degree of understanding!</p>

<p>To our former account of this animal we
may now add that there are two species of it
in Guiana, the one larger than the other; the former
weigh from twelve to fifteen pounds, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the latter about six: their principal food is the
leaves of trees, in the holes of which the females
bring forth their young; they commonly
bring forth two at a time, and yet they
are not very numerous. The negroes are very
fond of their flesh and describe it as extremely
good. From the account of M. de la Borde
they are solitary animals, except in the season
of love, when they go in pairs; they seldom
venture to appear during the day, and they
find a most inveterate enemy in the tiger who
destroys them at every opportunity.</p>

<p>This animal has never yet received a distinct
name: placed by Nature in the desert
part of North America, it exists in independence
far distant from man, and has not even
received from him a name, which is the first
mark of an animal&rsquo;s subjection. Hudson
having discovered the country where he inhabits,
we shall give him a name which has an
affinity with his first master, and which, at
the same time, indicates his sharp bristly nature.
It was likewise necessary to give him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
a name, that he might not be confounded with
the porcupine or coendou, which he resembles
in some few characters, but so materially differs
from them in other respects that he ought to be
looked upon as a different species. He is also
a native of the northern climates, while the
others particularly belong to that of the south.</p>

<p>Edward, Ellis, and Catesby, have all spoken
of this animal: the figures given by the two
first agree with ours, and we have no doubt
of their being the same animal. We are likewise
strongly inclined to believe, that the figure
and description Seba has given, under the
name of <i>the remarkable porcupine of the East
Indies</i>, and which afterwards Klein, Brisson,
and LinnÃ¦us, indicated in their methodical lists
by characters extracted from Seba, may be
the same animal as we are now treating of.
This would not, as we have already observed,
be the only time that Seba has spoken of American
animals as belonging to the East Indies.
However we cannot be so positive with respect
to this as we have been with many other animals;
all that we can say is, that the resemblances
appear to be very great, and the differences
very slight, and that these differences
may possibly be only varieties between individuals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
or such as distinguish the males from
the females.</p>

<p>The <i>urson</i> might be called the <i>bristly beaver</i>,
he being of the same country, the same size,
and the same form of body. He has, like the
beaver, two long, strong, and sharp incisive
teeth at the end of each jaw. Besides his
prickles, which are short, and almost covered
with hair, like the beaver, he has a double
coat, the first consists of long and soft hairs, and
the second of a down, which is still more soft
and smooth. In the young ursons the prickles
are proportionably larger, more apparent, and
the hair shorter and scarcer than in the adults.</p>

<p>This animal avoids moist places, and is even
fearful of wetting himself. They make their
habitations under the roots of great hollow trees,
sleep very much, and chiefly feed upon the
bark of juniper-bushes. In winter the snow
serves them for drink; and in summer they lap
water like a dog. The savages eat their flesh,
and strip the bristles off the hide, which they
make use of instead of pins and needles, and
clothe themselves with the fur.</p>

<p>The <i>Tanrecs</i>, or <i>Tendracs</i>, are small animals
of the East Indies, which resemble a little our
hedge-hogs, but differ from them sufficiently to
constitute a distinct species. This is strongly
proved by its not rolling itself up in the shape
of a ball, like the hedge-hog; and besides the
tanrecs are found at Madagascar, where there
are also hedge-hogs of the same species as ours,
which are not called there tanrecs but <i>soras</i>.</p>

<p>There appears to be two species of tanrecs,
or, perhaps, two different races; the first,
which is nearly as large as our hedge-hog, has
its muzzle proportionably longer than the
second; its ears are also more apparent, and is
more furnished with prickles than the second,
to which we have given the name of tendrac
to distinguish it from the first. The tendrac
(<a href="#FIG_164"><i>fig. 164.</i></a>) is not bigger than a large rat; its
muzzle and ears are shorter than those of the
tanrec, which is also covered with shorter
prickles, but they are as numerous as those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the hedge-hog; the tendrac, on the contrary,
has them only on the head, neck, and withers,
the rest of the body being covered with a coarse
hair resembling the bristles of a hog.</p>

<p>These small animals, whose legs are short,
move but slowly; they grunt, and wallow in the
mire like hogs; they are chiefly in creeks and
harbours of salt water; they multiply in great
numbers, and dig themselves holes in the
ground, whither they retire and sleep for several
months. During this torpid state their hair
falls off, which grows again upon their revival.
They are usually very fat, and although their
flesh is insipid, soft, and spongy, yet the Indians
consider it as a very great delicacy.</p>

<p>The Giraffe (<a href="#FIG_165"><i>fig. 165.</i></a>) is one of the tallest,
most useful, most beautiful, and harmless animals
in nature. The enormous disproportion
of his legs, the fore ones being as long again
as those behind, is a great obstacle to the exercise
of his powers. His motion is waddling,
slow, and stiff; he can neither fly from his
enemies in a free state, nor serve his master in
a domestic one. The species is not very numerous,
and has always been confined to the
desarts of Ethiopia, and to some other provinces
of Southern Africa and India. As these
countries were unknown to the Greeks, Aristotle
makes no mention of this animal. Pliny
speaks of it, and Oppian describes it in a
manner that is far from equivocal. &ldquo;The
camelopardalis (says this author) has some resemblance
to the camel; it has a spotted skin
like the panther, and a neck as long as the
camel; its head and ears are small, its feet
broad, and its legs long, but the last are very
unequal, the fore ones being much longer than
those behind, which are so short, that when the
animal is standing it has somewhat the appearance
of a dog sitting upon his posteriors.
There are two prominences upon the head
just between the ears, which resemble two
small and straight horns. Its mouth is like the
stag&rsquo;s; its teeth small and white; its eyes full
of fire; its tail short, and furnished with black
hairs at the end.&rdquo; By adding to this description
of Oppian those of Heliodorus and Strabo,
we shall have a sufficient idea of the camelopard.
&ldquo;The ambassadors of Ethiopia (says
Heliodorus) brought an animal about the size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of a camel, whose skin was speckled with beautiful
and glossy spots, the hinder parts were
much lower than the anterior; the neck was
slender, although rising from a tolerably thick
body; the head resembled that of the camel,
and in size was scarce double that of the ostrich;
the eyes appeared tinctured with different
colours. The motion of this animal was different
from that of all other quadrupeds, who
in walking lift their legs diagonally, that is,
the right leg before with the left leg behind;
but the camelopard goes naturally in an amble,
with its two right or its two left legs pacing
together. It is a gentle animal, and may be
conducted any where with a small cord tied
round its head.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is (says Strabo) a
large animal in Ethiopia called <i>camelopardalis</i>,
although it bears no resemblance to the panther,
for its skin is not spotted in the same manner;
the spots of the panther are circular, and those
of this animal are long, and nearly resembling
those of the fawn, or young stag. The posterior
parts of its body are much lower than the
anterior; so that towards the rump it is not
higher than the ox, while its shoulders are
higher than those of the camel. From this
disproportion it cannot run very swift. This
animal is gentle, does no injury, and feeds upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
grass, leaves, and vegetables.&rdquo; Among the
moderns, the first good description we meet
with is that of Belon. &ldquo;I saw (says he) an
animal at the castle of Cairo, which is commonly
called <i>zurnapa</i>; the Latins anciently
stiled it <i>camelopardalis</i>, a name compounded of
leopard and camel, for it is sprinkled with spots
like the first, and has a long neck like the
latter. It is a very beautiful animal, as
gentle as a lamb, and more sociable than any
other wild beast. Its head is almost like that
of the stag, excepting its size; on it are two
small horns, about half a foot long, covered
with hair; those of the male are longer than
those of the female. They both have ears as
large as those of a cow, and the tongue black,
like that of the ox; it has no incisive teeth in
the upper jaw; its neck is long, straight, and
slender; its horns round; its legs thin and long,
but so low behind that the animal appears to
be sitting; its feet are like those of the ox;
its tail, which hangs down almost to its hoof,
is round, and the hair on it is three times as
thick as that of a horse; the colour of the
hair on the body is white and red; its manner
of running is like the camel&rsquo;s; when it runs
its two fore feet go together; it lies on its
belly, and has a callous substance on the breast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and joints like that animal. When it grazes
it is obliged to spread its fore legs very wide,
and even then feeds with great difficulty,
therefore it rather chooses to feed on the leaves
of trees than to graze in the fields, especially
as its neck is exceedingly long, and can reach
to a great height.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gillius&rsquo;s description seems still better than
that of Belon. &ldquo;I have seen (says Gillius,
chap. ix.) three camelopards at Cairo; on their
heads are two horns six inches long, and in the
middle of their forehead a tubercle rises to
about the height of two inches, which appears
like a third horn. This animal is sixteen feet
high when he holds up his head. Its neck
alone is seven feet, and it is twenty-two feet
long from the tip of the nose to the end of the
tail; its fore and hind legs are nearly of an
equal height; but the thighs before are so
long in comparison to those behind, that its
back inclines like the roof of an house. Its
whole body is sprinkled with large yellow spots
which are nearly of a square form. Its feet
are cloven like the ox; its upper lip hangs
over the under; its tail is slender, with hair on
it to the very point; it ruminates like the ox,
and, like that animal, feeds upon herbage; its
mane extends from the top of the head to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
back. When it walks it seems as if its legs
and flanks on both sides were alternately lame;
and when it grazes, or drinks, it is obliged to
spread its fore legs prodigiously wide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gesner affirms, upon the authority of Belon,
that this animal sheds its horns like the deer;
but I must confess that I never could find such
a fact asserted in that author. He merely says,
as above, that the horns of the camelopard are
covered with hair; and he only speaks in one
other place of that animal, namely, when treating of
the axis, where he says, &ldquo;The camelopard
has a white skin, with broad spots sprinkled
over it, which, though red, are not so deep
as those of the axis.&rdquo; This fact, which however
I have not been able to meet with in any
part of Belon&rsquo;s work, would be of great importance
to decide the nature of the giraffe, for
if it sheds its horns every year it belongs to
the stag kind; and, on the contrary, if its horns
are permanent, it must be considered as belonging
to the ox or goat species; but, without
this precise knowledge, we cannot assert,
as our nomenclators have done, that the giraffe
is of the stag genus; and we are not a little
surprised that Hasselquist, who has given a
very long and dry description of this animal,
has been silent as to its nature.   After having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
methodically, that is to say, scholastically,
heaped together a hundred useless and trifling
characters, he does not say a single word on
the substance of the horns, and leaves us ignorant
whether they are solid or hollow, or whether
they fall off or not. I refer to the description
of Hasselquist, not for its utility, but
for its singularity, and to excite travellers to
make use of their own knowledge, and not to
view objects through the spectacles of other
men.</p>

<p>In the year 1764 a drawing and an account
of the giraffe was sent to the Academy of Sciences,
by which we are informed that this
animal is not particular to Ethiopia, but is also
found in the neighbourhood of the Cape of
Good Hope.<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a> The drawing was so badly executed
that no use can be made of it,<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a> but as
the account contains a sort of description we
have given it a place. &ldquo;In an excursion from
the Cape, made in 1762, we travelled about
two hundred leagues up the country, and met
with the <i>camelopardalis</i>, a drawing of which
we have subjoined. Its body resembles that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of an ox, and its head and neck those of the
horse. All we met with were of a white colour,
sprinkled with brown spots. They have two horns
on the head, about a foot long, and their
feet are hoofed. We killed two of these animals,
and sent their skins to Europe, the several
measurements of which were as follows:
the length of the head one foot eight inches;
the height, from the bottom of the fore foot to
the withers, ten feet; and from the withers to
the top of the head seven feet; in all seventeen
feet in height. The length from the withers
to the reins is five feet six inches, and from
thence to the tail one foot six; the length,
therefore, of the whole body is seven feet, and
the height, from the hind feet to the reins,
eight feet five inches. The great disproportion
in the height and length of this animal seems
to prevent its being of any service. It feeds
on the leaves of trees, and when it wants to
drink, or take any thing off the ground, it is
obliged to kneel with its fore legs.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AH_34" id="Footnote_AH_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AH_34"><span class="label">[AH]</span></a> Vaillant also, in his travels into the interior parts of
Africa, asserts, that he met with giraffes in very great
numbers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AI_35" id="Footnote_AI_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AI_35"><span class="label">[AI]</span></a> This we have also obviated, our figure being from a
drawing taken by M. Vaillant from life.</p></div>

<p>In inspecting the accounts travellers have
given of the giraffe, I find they all agree that
it can reach with its head to the height of sixteen
or seventeen feet when standing erect, and
that the fore legs are as high again as the hind
ones, so that it seems as if it was seated upon
its crupper. They likewise agree that it cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
run very swift, by reason of this disproportion;
that it is very gentle, and that by this
quality, other habits, and even by the shape of
the body, it partakes more of the nature of the
camel than of any other animal; that it is
among the number of ruminating animals,
and, like them, is deficient of the incisive teeth
in its upper jaw. By the testimonies of some
travellers we also find that the giraffe is to be
met with in the southern parts of Africa, as
well as in those of Asia.</p>

<p>It is very evident, from what we have
mentioned, that the giraffe is a peculiar species,
and totally different from every other
animal. If we would refer it to any it should
rather be to the camel than the stag, or the
ox. It is true the giraffe has two small
horns, and the camel none; but they resemble
each other so much in other respects that
I am not surprised at some travellers having
given it the name of the <i>Indian camel</i>. Besides,
we are ignorant of the substance of
the horns of the giraffe, and, consequently,
we know not if in that part he approaches
nearer to the stag than to the ox; and, possibly,
they may be of a substance different
from either; they may be composed of united
hairs like those of the rhinoceros, or of a
substance and texture peculiar to themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
The reasons which have induced nomenclators
to rank the giraffe with the stag kind, seem to
have arisen from the pretended passage of Belon,
quoted by Gesner, which indeed would be decisive
if it were true. They seem also to have
misunderstood what authors have said of the
hair of those horns; they have imagined that
the writers have said the horns of the giraffe
were covered with hair, like the fresh-sprung
horns of the stag, and from thence concluded
they were of the same nature; but, in fact,
the giraffe&rsquo;s horns are only surrounded with
coarse hair, and not covered with a down, or
velvet, like those of the stag. This circumstance
tends to support the probability that the
horns of the giraffe are composed of united
hair, like those of the rhinoceros, and their
bluntness at the extremities greatly favours
this idea. If, again, we consider that the
elk, rein-deer, stag, roe-buck, &amp;c. have their
horns always divided into branches or antlers,
and that, on the contrary, the horns of the
giraffe are only simple, and consist of one
stem, we must be convinced that they are
not of the same nature, unless analogy be entirely
violated. The tubercle is in the middle
of the head, which, according to travellers,
seem to form a third horn, is another strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
circumstance in favour of this opinion. The
two horns which are not pointed, but blunt at
the ends, are, perhaps, only tubercles somewhat
longer than the former. All travellers
also uniformly inform us that the female giraffes
have horns like the males, but that they are
smaller. If this animal were really of the stag
kind, analogy would here also be violated,
for of all animals of that genus there is only
the female rein-deer that has horns, the reason
of which we have before mentioned. On the
other hand, as the giraffe cannot graze but
with great difficulty on account of the excessive
height of its fore legs; as it chiefly and
almost solely feeds on the leaves and buds of
trees, it may be presumed, that the horns,
which are the most apparent superfluity of the
organic particles derived from the food, would
be analogous to the nature of the food, as well
as the horns of the stag. Time will confirm
the propriety of one or other of these conjectures.
One word more in Hasselquist&rsquo;s
description would have fixed these doubts,
and clearly determined the genus of this animal.
But scholars, who have only the gamut
of their master in their heads, or rather in their
pockets, cannot avoid making blunders and
essential omissions, because they entirely renounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
investigation, which should guide every
observer of Nature, and view her productions
through the false medium of arbitrary method,
which only serves to hinder them from reflecting
on the objects they meet with, and to calculate
the description of them on a bad and
erroneous model. As, in reality, all objects
differ materially from each other, so they
ought all to be treated differently; one single
striking character happily discovered, is
sometimes decisive, and often conveys
more knowledge of a subject than a thousand
trifling indexes. Whenever they are
numerous they consequently become equivocal
and common, and then they are at least superfluous,
if not prejudicial, to the real knowledge
of Nature, who sports with the forms we prescribe,
soars above all method, and can only be
perceived by the penetrating eye of Genius.</p>

<p>From M. Allemand we received a letter,
dated October, 1766, containing a number of
excellent observations respecting this animal,
and from which the following is an extract:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am in possession of a stuffed giraffe, and
since you expressed a desire to know the nature
of its horns I cut one of them off, and
send it to you; it is, however, necessary to
observe, that it belonged to a very young one.
I received it from the governor of the Cape,
who informed me that it was killed as it was
lying by the side of its mother; it was about
six feet in height, and its horns did not exceed
two inches and a half. These horns
were covered all over with skin and hairs; the
base was more than an inch broad, forming an
obtuse cone; and to be certain whether it was
solid or hollow I sawed it through longitudinally
with that part of the skull to which it
adhered, and I found its texture to resemble
that of the horns of the stag more than any
other animal. If indeed I were positive that a
horn which was sent me as belonging to a giraffe
did really belong to that animal, I should
not hesitate to say there was no difference
between them, except in the figure, this being
straight, and without branches. With respect
to the legs I conceive their disproportion
in length has been greatly magnified, for the
difference between the fore and hind ones of
this young animal is very slight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The horns of the giraffe being solid, and
their substance similar to those of the stag, there
could be no doubt of his ranking in the same
genus, especially if he sheds his horns annually
of which, however, we are still uncertain; but
we may safely assert he ought to be separated
from that of the ox, and all those animals
whose horns are hollow; and, indeed, until the
contrary be proved to be the fact, we cannot
do otherwise than consider the giraffe as a peculiar
species, in the same manner as the elephant,
rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, forming
a species which has no collaterals, and which
seems to be a privilege conferred by Nature
simply on those which are of the largest magnitude.</p>

<p>In the description of M. Allemand we freely
acknowledge that he has displayed much accuracy,
and a perfect intimacy with the subject;
but yet I apprehend that the longest of
the horns he did me the favour to transmit does
not belong to a giraffe, for the short one is very
thick, and that quite thin, comparatively with
their different lengths. In an anonymous description
which I received from Holland of this
animal it is stated, that the horns of a full-grown
giraffe are a foot long, and as thick as a
man&rsquo;s arm; according to which the horn we
are now considering being six inches long, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
ought to be full twice as thick, as it is, in reality;
and, indeed, it so perfectly resembles
the first horns of a young stag, that we can
have little doubt of its belonging to that
animal.</p>

<p>As to the nature of the giraffe&rsquo;s horns I feel
no hesitation in coinciding with the opinion of
M. Allemand. The protuberance on the front
is osseous, and may be considered as a third
horn; and as the horns adhere to the cranium,
they should be considered as osseous prolongations
of the head. In short the horn of the
giraffe appears to be a bone, differing from that
of the ox by its covering, the latter being entirely
surrounded with a horny substance, and
the former with hair and skin.</p>

<p>There are examples in every language,
of two different names being applied to the
same animal, one of which has a relation to its
wild state, and the other to its domestic. The
wild boar and the hog are the same animal,
under two names, no ways relative to any difference
in their natures, but to the condition of
the species; one part of which is under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
power of man and the other independent. It
is the same with respect to the lamas and the
pacos, which were the only domestic animals
of the ancient Americans: these names belonged
to them in their domestic state. The
wild lama was called huanacus, or guanaco;
and the wild pacos, vicuna, or vigogne.<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> I
conceived this remark necessary to avoid the
confusion of names. These animals are to be
found only in he New World: they seem even
to belong to some particular parts, beyond the
limits of which they are never to be seen.
They appear confined to that chain of mountains
which stretches from New Spain to Terra
Magellanica: they inhabit the highest regions
of the globe, and seem to require a purer and
more refined air than that of our highest mountains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AJ_36" id="Footnote_AJ_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AJ_36"><span class="label">[AJ]</span></a> The Peruvians yet call the lama by the name of <i>runa</i>,
which signifies sheep. <i>Lama</i> is a generic word signifying
<i>animal</i>, <i>brute</i>, and at this day they understand by the word
<i>runa llasna</i>, an Indian sheep. A modern traveller observes,
that the <i>guanaco</i> , and the <i>chillebueque</i> are animals quite distinct
from the <i>lama</i>. It is therefore improperly that these
names are found among these cited by Buffon as applied to
the <i>lama</i>.</p></div>

<p>It is singular, that although the lama and the
pacos are domestic in Peru, Mexico, and Chili,
like the horses in Europe, or the camels in
Arabia, we scarcely know any thing of them;
and notwithstanding the Spaniards have had
possession of those vast countries for above
centuries, not one of their authors have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
us complete histories, nor an exact description
of these animals, which they are using every
day! It is pretended indeed, that they cannot
be transported into Europe, nor even be
brought from their heights, without, at least,
risking their lives in a short time; but at
Quito, Lima, and many other towns, where
persons of literature reside, they might have
designed, described, and dissected these animals.
Herrera says but very little about them,
and Garcilassa only speaks from other authors.
Acosta and Gregoire de Bolivar have made the
greatest collections of facts relative to the natural
dispositions of lamas, and the advantages
to be derived from them; but they have left us
in the dark as to their interior conformation,
and of the length of time they go with young;
whether the lama and the pacos are two species
absolutely separate from each other; whether
they mix together, or whether there are
any intermediate breed, and a number of other
facts necessary to render their history complete.</p>

<p>Although it is pretended these animals die if
they are removed from their native country,
yet it is certain that after the conquest of
Peru, and for a long time after, some of
them were transported into Europe. The
animal spoken of by Gesner, by the name of
<i>allocamelus</i>, and of which he has given a figure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
is a lama, which was brought alive from Peru
to Holland in 1558. It is the same with that
Matthiolus mentions by the name of <i>elaphocamelus</i>,
the description of which he has given
with great care and accuracy. The pacos,
and, perhaps, also the lamas, have been often
transported into Spain, to endeavour to naturalize
them. We ought, therefore, to be better
informed of the nature of these animals,
which might prove very useful to us; for,
probably, they would thrive as well upon the
Pyrenean and Alpine mountains as on the
Cordeliers.</p>

<p>Peru, according to Gregoire de Bolivar, is
the native country of the lamas: they have
indeed been conducted into other provinces,
as New Spain, &amp;c. but this is rather from
curiosity than utility. But in Peru, from
Potosi to Caracas, these animals are in great
numbers; they constitute the chief riches of
the Indians, and add not a little to the wealth
of the Spaniards, who rear them. Their flesh
is excellent food; their wool may be spun into
beautiful cloathing; and they are capable of
carrying heavy loads in the most rugged and
dangerous ways. The strongest of them will
travel with from one hundred and fifty, to
two hundred and fifty pounds weight on their
backs; their pace is but slow, and their journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
is seldom above fifteen miles a day; but,
then, they are sure-footed, descend precipices,
and travel safely among the most craggy rocks,
where even men can scarce accompany them.
They commonly travel for five days together,
and then they are obliged to rest, which they
do of their own accord for two or three days
before they resume their journey. They are
much employed in carrying the riches dug
out of the mines of Potosi. Bolivar affirms,
that in his time about three hundred thousand
of these animals were thus kept in actual employ.</p>

<p>The growth of the lama is very quick, and
its life is but of short duration. This animal
couples at three years of age, and remains
strong and vigorous till twelve, after which it
begins to decline, and becomes entirely useless
at fifteen.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> Their nature appears to be modelled
on that of the Americans; they are
gentle and phlegmatic, and do every thing with
the greatest leisure and caution. When they
stop on their journeys to rest, they bend their
knees very cautiously, in order to lower their
bodies without disordering their load; and as
soon as they hear their driver whistle, they rise
up again with the same precaution, and proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
on their journey. They feed as they go
along, whenever they can find grass; but they
never eat in the night, even though they have
fasted all day; they employ that time to ruminate.
When they sleep or ruminate, they
rest with their feet folded under their bellies.
When overloaded, or fatigued, they sink
down, and will not rise again though the driver
strikes him with his utmost force. His last
resource to urge them forward by means of
anguish, is to compress their testicles; this
often is of no effect, and if the driver continues
his torments the animal grows desperate, and
kills himself by violently beating his head
against the earth: they do not make any defence
either with their feet or teeth, and it may
be said, they have no other arms than those of
indignation. When persecuted they spit in
the face of those who oppress them; and the
Indians say, that this saliva is of such an
acrimonious nature, as to cause very dangerous
eruptions on the skin.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AK_37" id="Footnote_AK_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AK_37"><span class="label">[AK]</span></a> At Chili, according to Molina, they consider thirty
years as the ordinary term of the life of a lama; and it is
certain that these animals begin to propagate at the age of
three years.</p></div>

<p>The lama is about four feet high; its body,
comprehending the neck and head<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a>, is five or six
feet long. The head is small and well proportioned;
the eyes large, the nose somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
long, the lips thick, the upper one being divided,
and the under a little pendulous. He has
neither incisive nor canine teeth in the upper
jaw. His ears are four inches long, which he
moves with great agility. His tail is seldom
above eight inches long; small, straight, and
a little turned up at the end. He is cloven
footed, like the ox, but he has a kind of spur
behind, which assists the animal to support
himself over precipices and rugged ways. His
back, crupper, and tail, are cloathed with a short
wool, but it is very long on the belly and sides.
These animals differ in colour; some are white,
others black, but most of them a mixed brown.
The dung of the lamas is like that of the
goat. The genital members in the male are
slender and turned back, so that it passes its
water backwards; they are much inclined to
venery, although they copulate with difficulty.
The female has a very small aperture; she
prostrates herself to receive the male, whom she
invites with her sighs; but a whole day is sometimes
passed before they can accomplish their
purpose; and all this time is spent in growling,
quarrelling, and spitting at each other; and as
these long preludes fatigue them, the Indians
assist them to commence the operation. They
seldom produce more than one at a time. The
mother has but two teats, and the young one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
follows her as soon as it is brought forth. The
flesh of the young lamas is excellent food, but
that of the old ones is dry and tough. In general,
both the flesh and wool of the domestic
lamas is preferable to that of the wild: their
skin is firm: the Indians make their shoes
of it, and the Spaniards use it for harness.
These useful, and even necessary, animals in
the countries they inhabit, are attended with
no expence to their masters; as they are cloven-footed
they do not require to be shod, and
their wool renders saddles unnecessary. Satisfied
with a small portion of vegetables and
grass they want neither corn nor hay; and
they are still more moderate in what they
drink, as their mouths are continually moistened
with saliva, which they have in greater
quantity than any other animal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AL_38" id="Footnote_AL_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AL_38"><span class="label">[AL]</span></a> Their necks are as long as those of the camel, to which
animal they have a great resemblance, excepting the bunch
on the back.</p></div>

<p>The huanacus, or wild lamas, are stronger,
brisker, and swifter, than the domestic ones;
they run like a stag, and climb over the most
craggy precipices like the goat: their wool
is shorter, and their colour tawny. These
animals, even when in a state of freedom, assemble
in herds, sometimes to the number of
two or three hundred. When they see any
of the human species, they regard him at
first with astonishment, without marking any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
fear or surprise; but shortly, as if by common
consent, they blow through their nostrils,
neigh somewhat like horses, and then by a
general flight, take refuge on the tops of the
mountains. They are fonder of the north
than the south side of the hills. They climb,
and often remain above the snowy tracts of
the mountains; and when travelling on the
ice covered with hoar-frost, they seem in
the best condition, and appear vigorous in
proportion to the coldness of their situation.
The natives hunt the wild lama for the sake
of its fleece: the dogs have much trouble to
follow them; and if they once gain the rocks,
both hunters and dogs are obliged to desist
from the pursuit. They are very numerous
all along the chain of the Cordeliers which
are full 3000 fathoms above the level of
the sea at Peru, and preserve that elevation
from Chili, to the straits of Magellan; but on
the coast of New Spain, where the mountains
sink in height, none of these animals are to be
found.</p>

<p>The pacos are a subordinate kind to the
lamas, much in the same proportion as the ass
is to the horse: they are smaller, and not so
serviceable, but their fleeces are more useful.
Their wool is fine and long, and it constitutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a sort of merchandize, as dear and valuable as
silk. When in a domestic state they are called
<i>alpaques</i>; they are then sometimes black, or
brown mixed with yellow, but the natural
colour of the pacos is that of a dried rose-leaf,
which is so fixed, that it undergoes no alteration
under the hands of the manufacturer. They
not only make good gloves and stockings of
this wool, but also form it into quilts and carpets,
which sell at a very high price, and form
a valuable part of the Spanish commerce.</p>

<p>The pacos possesses many things in common
with the lamas; they belong to the same country,
are of the same dispositions, manners, and
nearly the same temperament; they also resemble
the lamas in their figure; being however
smaller, their legs shorter, and their muzzles
thicker and closer: they have no horns; they
inhabit and pasture on the highest parts of the
mountains. Snow and ice seem rather to
refresh than to disagree with them: they keep
together in flocks, and run very swift; they
are very timid, and as soon as they perceive
any person they take flight, driving their
young before them. The ancient monarchs
of Peru rigorously prohibited the hunting of
them, because they multiply so slowly; and
since the arrival of the Spaniards in those parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
their number is greatly decreased. The flesh
of these animals is not so good as that of the
huanacus, and they are only sought after for
their fleece, and the bezoars they produce.
The method of taking them, proves their extreme
timidity, or rather their weakness. The
hunters drive a flock of them into a narrow
passage, across which they have stretched cords
about four feet from the ground, with a number
of pieces of linen or woollen cloth hanging
to them. The animals are so intimidated at
these rags, agitated by the wind, that they stop,
and crowding together in a heap, great numbers
of them are killed with the greatest ease.
But if there happen to be any hunacus among
the flock, as they are less timid than the pacos,
they leap over the cords; the example is immediately
followed by the whole group, and
then they escape from their pursuers.</p>

<p>In respect to the domestic pacos; they are
employed to carry burdens, like the lamas; but
they carry a much less weight even in proportion
to their size. They are likewise of a more
stubborn nature, and when once they lie down
with their load, they will suffer themselves to
be cut to pieces sooner than rise. The Indians
never make use of the milk of these animals,
because they have scarcely enough to supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
their own young. The great profit derived
from their wool, induced the Spaniards to endeavour
to naturalize them in Europe: they
transported numbers of them into Spain, but
the climate was so inimical to their nature that
they every one perished: nevertheless, I am
persuaded, as I have already observed, that
these animals, more valuable than the lamas,
might live and procreate upon our mountains,
especially upon the Pyrennees. Those who
brought them into Spain, did not consider
that they cannot exist even in Peru, but in the
cold regions, that is on the tops of the highest
mountains; that they are never to be found in
the valleys, and die if brought into warm
countries. That on the contrary, they are still
very numerous in the neighbourhood of the
Straits of Magellan, where the cold is much
greater than in the south of Europe; and that,
consequently, in order to preserve them, they
should be landed, not in Spain, but in Scotland,
or even in Norway; or probably with greater
certainty at the foot of the Pyrenean, Alpine,
or other mountains, where they might climb
to the region that most agrees with their nature.
I have dwelt the more on this subject,
because I imagine these animals would prove
an excellent acquisition to Europe, and would
produce more real advantage than all the metals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of the New World, which only load us with a
useless weight; for before the discovery of
those mines, a pennyweight of gold or silver
was of as much value as an ounce is at this
present time.</p>

<p>Animals which feed upon vegetables, and
live on the high mountains of Asia and Africa,
produce the oriental bezoar, the virtues of
which are so highly extolled. The animals of
the mountains of Europe, where the qualities
of the plants are more temperate, only produce
the <i>Ã¦gagropili;</i> and in South America those
animals which dwell upon the mountains of
the torrid zone, afford another kind of bezoar,
called <i>occidental</i>, more solid, and perhaps
possessing greater virtues than the <i>oriental</i>.
The wild pacos produces it in great quantities,
as do the huanacus; and it is also extracted
from the stags or roe-bucks of New Spain.
The lamas and the pacos afford the best bezoar
when in their natural or wild state: those produced
in their state of slavery are small, black,
and of but little or no virtue. The best bezoars
are those of a dark green colour, which
commonly proceed from the wild pacos, especially
those which feed in the snow on the tops
of the mountains. Of these, both the male and
female produce bezoars; and these Peruvian
bezoars are the next in rank to the oriental,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and are much more esteemed than those of
New Spain, which are produced by stags, and
are the least efficacious of any.</p>

<p>These two animals have had the name of
<i>Sloths</i> given to them on account of their slowness,
and the difficulty with which they walk.
Though they resemble each other in many respects,
nevertheless they differ externally and
internally by such strong characters that it is
impossible to mistake the one for the other, or
doubt of their being very distinct species. The
unau (<a href="#FIG_166"><i>fig. 166.</i></a>) has no tail, and only two claws
on the fore feet. The aÃ¯ has a short tail, and
three claws on each foot. The nose of the
unau is likewise longer, the forehead higher,
and the ears larger than the aÃ¯. They differ
also in the hair. Some parts of their viscera
are formed and situated different; but the most
distinct and singular character is, the unau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
has forty-six ribs; and the aÃ¯ but twenty-eight;
this alone proves them to be two species quite
distinct from each other. These forty-six ribs
in an animal whose body is so short is a kind
of excess, or error, in nature; for even in the
largest animals, and those whose bodies are relatively
longer than they are thick, not one of
them is found to have so many; the elephant
has only forty, the horse thirty-six, the badger
thirty, the dog twenty-six, the human species
twenty-four, &amp;c. This difference in the construction of
the sloths supposes a greater dissimilitude
between these two species than there
is between the cat and dog, both of which have
the same number of ribs. External differences
are nothing in comparison with internal ones.
The internal frame of living animals is the
groundwork of Nature&rsquo;s design, it is the constituent
form, and the cause of all figure;
and the external parts are only the surface or
drapery. In our comparative examination
of animals, how many have we seen who
often differed very much in their outward
appearance and yet were perfectly alike internally;
and, on the contrary, the least internal
distinction has produced great external differences,
and even changed the natural habits, faculties,
and attributes of the animal? How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
many also are there armed, cloathed, and even
ornamented with superfluous parts, which, nevertheless,
in their internal organization entirely
resemble others who are deficient in these
excrescences? but we shall not here dwell on
this subject, which supposes, not only a reflected
comparison, but also an exposition of all
the parts of organization; we shall only observe,
that in proportion as Nature is lively,
active, and exalted in the ape species, she is
slow, constrained, and cramped in the sloths.
These animals have neither incisive nor canine
teeth; their eyes are dull, and almost concealed
with hair; their mouths are wide, and their
lips thick and heavy; their fur is coarse, and
looks like dried grass; their thighs seem almost
disjointed from the haunches; their legs very
short and badly shaped; they have no soles to
their feet, nor toes separately moveable, but
only two or three claws excessively long and
crooked downwards, which move together,
and are only useful to the animal in climbing.
Slowness, stupidity, and even habitual pain,
result from its uncouth conformation. They
have no arms either to attack or defend themselves;
nor are they furnished with any means
of security, as they can neither scratch up the
earth nor seek for safety by flight, but confined
to a small spot of ground, or to the tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
under which they are brought forth, they remain
prisoners in the midst of an extended
space, unable to move more than three feet in
an hour; they climb with difficulty and pain;
and their plaintive and interrupted cry they
dare only utter by night. All these circumstances
announce their wretchedness, and call
to our mind those imperfect sketches of Nature,
which, having scarcely the power to exist,
only remained a short time in the world,
and then were effaced from the list of beings.
In fact, if it were not a desart country where
the sloths exist, but had been long inhabited
by man and powerful animals, they would not
have descended to our time; the whole species
would have been destroyed, as at some future
period will certainly be the case. We have
already observed, that it seems as if all that
<i>could</i> be, <i>does</i> exist; and of this the sloths appear
to be a striking proof. They constitute
the last term of existence in the order of animals
endowed with flesh and blood. One more
defect and they could not have existed. To
look on these unfinished creatures as equally
perfect beings with others; to admit final
causes for such disparities, and from thence to
determine Nature to be as brilliant in these as
in her most beautiful animals, is only looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
at her through a straight tube, and making
its confines the final limit of our judgment.</p>

<p>Why should not some animals be created
for wretchedness, since in the human species
the greatest number are devoted to pain and
misery from their birth? Certainly, evil is
more our own production than that of Nature.
For one man who is unhappy from being born
weak and deformed, thousands are rendered so
by the oppression and cruelty of their fellow-creatures.
Animals are, in general, more happy,
because each species has nothing to dread
from their individuals; to them there is but
one source of evil, but to the human species
there are two. Moral evil, which he has produced
himself, is a torrent which is increased
into a sea, whose inundation covers and afflicts
the whole face of the earth. Physical evil, on
the contrary, is confined to very narrow limits;
it seldom appears alone or unaccompanied
with an equal if not a superior good. Can
animals be denied happiness when they enjoy
freedom, and have the faculty of easily procuring
subsistence, when they are less subject to
ill health, and possess the necessary or relative
organs of pleasure in a more eminent degree
than the human species? In these respects animals
in general are very richly endowed; and
the degraded species of the sloths are, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the only creatures to whom Nature has been
unkind, and the only ones which present us
the image of innate misery and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Let us now inspect their condition more
closely; being unfurnished with teeth they
cannot seize upon prey, nor feed upon flesh or
vegetables; reduced to live on leaves and wild
fruits, they consume much time in crawling to
a tree, and still more in climbing up to the
branches; and during this slow and painful labour,
which sometimes lasts many days, they
are obliged to support the most pressing hunger.
When they have accomplished their end
they cling to the tree, crawl from branch to
branch, and, by degrees, strip every twig of its
leaves. In this situation they remain several
weeks without any liquid; and when they have
consumed the store, and the tree is entirely
naked, they still continue, unable to descend until
the pressure of hunger becomes more powerful
than the fear of danger or death, and they suffer
themselves to fall to the ground like an inanimate
mass, without being capable of exerting
any effort to break the violence of the fall.</p>

<p>When on the ground they are exposed to all
their enemies, and as their flesh is not absolutely
bad they are sought after both by men
and beasts of prey. They seem to multiply
but little, or if they produce often it is only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
small number at a time, as they are furnished
with but two teats: every thing, therefore, concurs
to their destruction, and the species supports
itself with great difficulty. Although
they are slow, heavy, and almost incapable of
motion, yet they are hardy, strong, and tenacious
of life; they can exist a long time deprived
of all food; they are covered with a thick,
coarse fur, and being unable to take much
exercise they waste little by perspiration, and
therefore they fatten by rest, however poor
their food. Though they have neither horns
nor hoofs, nor incisive teeth in the lower jaw,
they belong, notwithstanding, to the number of
ruminating animals, and have four stomachs,
so that they may compensate for the quality of
their food by the quantity they take at a time;
and what is still more singular, instead of having,
like other ruminating animals, very long
intestines, they are very short, like those of the
carnivorous kind. The ambiguity of Nature
seems somewhat discovered by this contrast.
The sloths are certainly ruminating animals,
as they have four stomachs; but they are deficient
in all the other external and internal
characters which belong to all animals in that
class. There is also another singularity in
these animals, instead of distinct apertures for
the discharge of the urine, excrements, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the purposes of generation, these animals have
but one, which terminates in a common canal,
as in birds.</p>

<p>Finally, if the misery which results from a
defect of sensation be not the greatest of all,
the miserable state of these animals, although
very apparent, seems not to be real, for they
appear to have little or no sensation, and their
dull and heavy look, their indifference to blows,
which they receive without being in the least
affected, prove their insensibility. But what
still further demonstrates this fact is, their not
instantly dying upon their hearts and bowels
being taken out. Piso, who made this cruel
experiment, says, that the heart, after being separated
from the body, beat forcibly for more
than half an hour, and that the animal continued
to contract its limbs in the same manner
as when asleep.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> From these circumstances
this quadruped approaches not only the tortoise
but also other reptiles who have no distinct
centre of sensation: thus all these animals are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
miserable without being unhappy; and Nature,
even in her most unfinished productions,
appears always to act more as a real parent,
than a step-mother.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AM_39" id="Footnote_AM_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AM_39"><span class="label">[AM]</span></a> Sonnini says, that wishing to kill a sloth for the purpose
of preparing the skin, he exhausted every possible means to
deprive it of life; but such was its principle of vitality that
he could not remain any longer a witness of his own barbarous
endeavours; and he quitted the room seized with horror
at the idea of the evils which this miserable animal
must endure, and with astonishment at that impenetrability
which prolonged its existence.</p></div>

<p>Both these animals belong to the southern
parts of the New Continent, and are never to
be met with in the Old. We have already
observed, that the editor of Seba&rsquo;s cabinet was
deceived in calling the unau by the name of
the <i>Ceylon sloth</i>. This error, which has been
adopted by Klein, LinnÃ¦us, and Brisson, is
now more evident than formerly. The Marquis
de Montmirail has a living unau, which
was brought him from Surinam: those in the
royal cabinet came from the same place, and
from Guiana; and I am persuaded, that both
species exist in the desarts of America, from
Brasil to Mexico; but as it never inhabited the
northern countries, it could not have passed
from one continent to the other; and if these
animals have been seen either in the East Indies,
or on the coast of Africa, it is certain, that
they must have been transported thither. They
can endure neither cold nor rain; the change
from wet to dry spoils their fur, which then resembles
bad dressed hemp, rather than wool or
hair.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this article better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
by inserting the observations which the Marquis
de Montmirail communicated to me
concerning the unau, which had been above
three years in his menagerie. &ldquo;The fur
of the unau is much softer than that of the
aÃ¯. It is probable that what travellers have
said of the excessive slowness of the sloths,
only belongs to the aÃ¯. The unau, although
very heavy, and of an excessively aukward
motion, ascends and descends the highest
tree many times in a day: he is most active
in the evening and during the night, which
makes it probable that he sees but badly
in the day, and that his eyes are of no use
to him but in the dark. When I bought
this animal at Amsterdam, it was fed with
sea-biscuit, and I was told, that when the
winter was over, and the verdure began to appear,
it would require nothing but leaves.
We supplied him with leaves which he ate
freely while they were green and tender;
but the moment they began to be dry, shrivelled,
or worm-eaten, he refused them. During
the three years that I preserved him in
my menagerie, his common food was bread,
apples, and roots; and his drink always
milk. He always took his food in one of his
fore-claws, but with difficulty, and which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
increased in proportion to the size. His cry,
though plaintive and melancholy, does not resemble
that of the aÃ¯; it is short, and seldom
uttered. The most natural situation of the
unau, and which he prefers to all others, is
suspending himself on a branch of a tree, with
his body downwards. He sometimes even
sleeps in this position, his four claws fastened
on the same point, and his body describing
the figure of a bow. The strength of his muscles
is incredible; but it becomes useless to him
when he walks, for his motion then is not the
less constrained or tottering. This formation
alone seems to be the cause of the slowness of
this animal, who besides has no violent sensation,
and does not recognize the hand that
feeds him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have been informed by M de la Borde,
that in Cayenne there are two species of sloths,
whose principal differences consist in the length
of their bodies, the one, which is called the
<i>sheep sloth</i>, being nearly twice as long as the
other, known by the name of the <i>bashful sloth</i>.
The first has bushy hair of a dirty white; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
weighs about twenty-five pounds; he climbs to
the tops of trees, from whence he throws himself
down in a very aukward manner. The
latter does not weigh more than twelve pounds;
he has some black spots on different parts of his
body, and his hair is not so rough as the other.
Both species produce but one young at a time,
and which they carry with them on their backs;
and there is some reason to believe the female
brings forth on the trees; the leaves of which,
form the general food of both species, and which
are equally common. They frequently suspend
themselves by their claws from the branches
of the trees, and when so situated they may be
taken at pleasure, as they will suffer the branch
to be cut asunder without letting go their hold.
They ascend the trees by sticking in their fore
claws alternately, and so drag up their bodies,
but the slowness of their motion, is almost incredible.
When kept in the house, they climb
up the sides of a door or post, and never rest
upon the ground; and if a stick is put to them,
they will climb to the top and cling to it with
their whole body.</p>

<p>It is plain from the above description, that
the sheep sloth is the same as that we have
spoken of under the name of the unau, and
that this bashful sloth of our aÃ¯.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>M. VosmaÃ«r has denied the assertion in my
history of these animals, that they are unable
to descend from a tree, but allow themselves to
drop down like inanimate blocks; I had the
fact from eye-witnesses, and it is now supported
by the testimony of M. de la Borde.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a>
With respect to my other assertion, that the
sloths have no teeth, I readily admit my mistake
and feel myself indebted to M. VosmaÃ«r
for correcting the error.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AN_40" id="Footnote_AN_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AN_40"><span class="label">[AN]</span></a> Ulloa also in his voyage to Peru, says, that the unau
climbs up the tree which is the most laden with fruit; and
that when he has done, he rolls himself up into a round ball,
and lets himself fall plump down, to avoid the trouble of
descending.</p></div>

<p>This animal was purchased in Holland by
the name of the <i>Surikat</i>. It is a native of
Surinam, and other provinces of South America.
We kept one for some time; and afterwards
delivered it to M. de SevÃ©, who has so
carefully drawn the animals in this Work:
during the time that gentleman kept him alive,
he made some remarks of his natural habits,
which he communicated to me. This animal is
very handsome, lively, and subtle; he sometimes
walks on his hind legs, and often sits upright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
on them, with his fore paws hanging
down, his head erect, and moving on the neck
as on a pivot. He always assumed that posture
when he came near the fire for warmth.
He is not so big as a rabbit, and nearly resembles
the ichneumon in size and hair; his
tail is somewhat shorter. His snout is prominent
and raised; and by which character
he is more like the coati than any other animal.
He has also a character peculiar to him and
the hyÃ¦na; as these two are the only animals
who have four toes to every foot.</p>

<p>At first we fed this animal with milk, as he
was very young; but his inclination for flesh
soon shewed itself. He ate raw meat with
eagerness, and was particularly fond of poultry.
He also endeavoured to seize young animals.
A small rabbit would have fallen a
prey to him if he had not escaped. He was
very fond of fish, and still more of eggs. He
would take out eggs that were put in water
to be boiled, and carry them off with his paws.
He would eat neither fruit nor bread. He
used his fore-feet, like a squirrel, to carry food
to his mouth. He lapped his drink like a
dog, but would not touch water unless it was
luke-warm. His common drink was his own
urine, although of a very strong smell. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
played with cats with the greatest familiarity.
He did no injury to children, and never bit any
person in the house but its master, against
whom he had taken an aversion. He never
gnawed with his teeth, but often scratched
plaister and furniture with his nails. He was
so well tamed, that he answered to his name,
when called, and went loose about the house.
He had two kind of voices, one like the barking
of a young dog, when it was left long alone,
or heard an unusual noise; and when caressed,
or desirous of expressing pleasure, he made a
noise as strong as that of a rattle briskly turned.
This was a female animal, and only lived one
winter, notwithstanding all the care that was
taken to feed and keep her warm.</p>

<p>Besides the master of the house, which
we formerly observed, we have since been informed
that the Surikat bit a number of other
persons and to which it seemed induced by some
particular smell; for when laid hold of, it always
curled up its nose to smell the person,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and an observation was made that it never failed
to bite those whom it had bit before, however
often they came near it, and this experiment
was made by several people; to some persons
it seemed to have such an aversion that it
would use various stratagems to get at them,
and if it could not bite their legs, it would lay
hold of their shoes or petticoats.</p>

<p>M. VosmaÃ«r says, in his work, &ldquo;it is probable
M. de Buffon was deceived both in
respect to the name and native country of the
Surikat, which was last summer sent by M.
Tulbagh to the Prince of Orange; for it belongs
to Africa and not to America. This
small animal is not mentioned by Kolbe, and
possibly was not known to him, for with a male
and female transmitted to me I received the
following note from the governor: <i>I send by
the captain two small animals, a male and female
of which I neither know their names nor the
species to which they belong; they were
brought from the remote desarts and stony
mountains of this country, and were the first
we had seen. They are very gentle and feed
upon fresh meat either dressed or raw, eggs
and ants.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I certainly do not mean to contend against
the evidence of M. Tulbagh, or deny the justness
of M. de VosmaÃ«r&rsquo;s remark, for I had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
other authority for the name and country of
this animal, although I kept him a considerable
time alive, than that of the man from whom I
bought it, who said he purchased it in Holland
by the name of Surikat, and that it came from
Surinam. But we are now certain it does not
belong to South America, but to the mountains
of Africa above the Cape of Good Hope;
as to its name we are still uninformed, but
which can easily be changed whenever that in
its native country can be procured.</p>

<p>We saw this animal (<a href="#FIG_167"><i>fig. 167.</i></a>) by chance
and in the possession of a person who could
neither inform us whence it came, nor
how it was called. It is remarkable for the
excessive length of its hind legs. The
bones of the feet, and especially those which
compose the upper part of the <i>tarsus</i> are
of an extraordinary length, and it is from
this distinctive character we have taken
its name.   The tarsier, however, is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
only animal whose hind feet are thus formed;
the tarsus of the jerboa is still longer, therefore
the name of <i>tarsia</i>, which we have given
to it must only be considered as a precarious
appellation, which ought to be laid
aside when the name it bears in its native
country is known. The jerboa is found in
Egypt, Barbary and the East Indies. At first
I imagined the tarsier might belong to the same
countries from its resemblance to that animal;
they are both of the same size, which is not
bigger than that of a middling rat; both have
prodigious long tails furnished at their ends
with long hairs; both have their hind legs
excessively long, and those before extremely
short; both have large eyes, and large erect
ears; both have the lower part of their hind
legs without any hair, while all the rest of their
body is covered with it. These animals having
thus in common such singular characters, there
seemed to be a probability of their being
similar species, or at least two species produced
in the same climate: nevertheless, in comparing
them together, in other respects, it becomes not
only doubtful, but almost certain that it is
no such thing. The tarsier has five toes to
every foot; and may be said to have four
hands, for the toes are very long and sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
divided; the largest of those behind, or the
thumb, is terminated by a flat nail; and although
the nails of the other toes are pointed,
they are so short and so small, that they do
not prevent the animal from using its four feet
like hands. The jerboa, on the contrary, has
only four toes and four long and crooked
claws on its fore feet, and instead of a thumb,
it has only a tubercle without a nail. But what
removes it further from our tarsier, it has only
three toes or three great claws on the hind feet.
This difference is too great for animals whose
species approach each other; and it is not impossible
but they belong to distant climates;
for the tarsier, by its small size, four hands,
long toes, little claws, and its long tail and
feet, seems to have a much greater affinity with
the Mexican and other opossums. But we
mean only to mention our doubts, and should
be greatly obliged to those who can indicate to
us the real climate and name of this little animal,<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a>
rare and singular.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AO_41" id="Footnote_AO_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AO_41"><span class="label">[AO]</span></a> Sonnini observes, that this rare and singular animal is
found in the most distant islands of the Indian Ocean, and
more particularly at Amboyna, where it is called the <i>podie</i>
in the language of Madagascar. This is the only additional
fact that has been acquired respecting the tarsier, since the
time of Buffon.</p>

<p>Two animals, a male and female, which
were sent to us by the name of <i>Surinam rats</i>,
but which have much less affinity to rats, than
with those animals with which we have given
the history under the names of the <i>marmose</i> and
<i>cayopollin</i>. We have, therefore, rejected the
denomination of Surinam rats, as complex and
misapplied. As it has never been mentioned
by any naturalist or traveller, we have called
it <i>phalanger</i>, (<a href="#FIG_168"><i>fig. 168.</i></a>) from its <i>phalanges</i>
being singularly formed, and because the two
first toes on the fore-feet are joined to each
other to the end of the last phalanx, and are
separated only near the claws; the thumb is
separated from the other toes and has no
claws; this last character, although remarkable,
is not peculiar, for the Virginia and murine
opossums have the same, but none of them
have the <i>phalanges</i> fastened together.</p>

<p>These animals vary in the colour<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> of the
hair, they are about the size of a small rabbit,
or a very large rat, and are remarkable for the
excessive length of their tail, snout, and the
form of their teeth, which alone is sufficient to
distinguish them from the opossums, the rats,
and every other species of animals with which
it may be supposed to relate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AP_42" id="Footnote_AP_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AP_42"><span class="label">[AP]</span></a> The hair on the upper part of the body is reddish mixed
with light ash colour and yellow. The hind part of the
head and middle of the back, are marked with a black line.
The throat, belly, legs, and part of the tail, are of a dirty
yellowish white. <i>Pennant&rsquo;s Synopsis.</i></p></div>

<p>I discovered this animal, which was
sent me from America, under the name of the
<i>orange-coloured squirrel</i>, to be the same as that
which Fernandes calls <i>quauhicollotquapachli
cozticotequallin</i>: but as these Mexican words
are very difficult to pronounce, I have abridged
the last to <i>coquallin</i> (<a href="#FIG_169"><i>fig. 169.</i></a>). It is not
a squirrel, although it greatly resembles that
animal both in the figure and bushiness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
tail, for it not only differs by many external
characters, but also by its disposition and
manners.</p>

<p>The coquallin is much larger than the squirrel;
<i>in duplam fere crescit magnitudinem</i>, says
Fernandes. It is a pretty animal, and very remarkable
for its colours; its belly is of a fine
yellow, and its head as well as body variegated
with white, black, brown and orange.
It covers its back with its tail like the squirrel;
but has not, like that animal, small brushes of
hair at the tips of the ears: he never climbs
up trees, but dwells in holes under the roots of
trees, like the ground squirrel, where it brings
forth its young; it likewise stores up corn and
fruit to feed on during winter; it is a jealous
and cunning animal, and so wild that it is impossible
to be tamed.</p>

<p>The coquallin is only found in the southern
parts of America. The white and orange-coloured
squirrels of the East Indies are much
smaller, and their colours are uniform. Those
are true squirrels which dwell and produce
their young on trees; but the coquallin, and
the American ground squirrel, burrow under
ground like rabbits, and have no other affinity
to squirrels than their resemblance in form.</p>

<p>The Hamster (<a href="#FIG_170"><i>fig. 170.</i></a>) is the most famous
and the most destructive rat that exists.
The reason why we did not give its history
among the other rats was because, at that time
we had not been able to procure one of them;
and we are now indebted for the knowledge we
have acquired of it to the Marquis de Montmirail
and M. de Waitz, who has sent us two
living hamsters with an instructive memoir on
their manners and natural habits. We fed one
of these animals for many months, for the
purpose of examining it with attention, and
afterwards dissected it, in order to compare its
internal structure with that of other rats, and
observed, that in its interior parts it resembled
more the water rat than any other animal; it
resembled him also by the smallness of its eyes
and the fineness of its hair; but its tail, instead
of being long, is much shorter than that of the
short-tailed field mouse, which, as we have
already observed, greatly resembles the water-rat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in its internal conformation. All these
animals live under the earth, and seem to be
animated with the same instinct. They have
nearly the same habits, and particularly that of
collecting corn, &amp;c. and making great magazines
in their holes: we shall, therefore, dwell
much less on the resemblances of shape and
dispositions, than upon differences which distinguished
the hamster from all the other rats
and mice, and field-mice, we have already
spoken of.</p>

<p>Agricola is the first author who has given
precise and particular indications of this animal.
Fabricius added several facts, but
Schwenckfeld has done more than all the rest;
he dissected the hamster, and gave a description of
it, which agrees almost entirely with
ours; notwithstanding which he has not been
quoted by naturalists of a more modern date,
who have been contented with copying Gesner;
and yet it is but justice to that author to
remark, his observations are so full and correct,
that by subjoining those of M. de Waitz
we have whatever can be wished for on the
subject of this animal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The habitations of the hamsters are of different
constructions, according to the sex and
age, and also according to the quality of the
land. That of the male has an oblique passage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
at the entrance of which is a quantity of earth
thrown up. At a distance from the entrance
there is a hole which descends perpendicularly
into the chambers, or cavities of the habitation.
There is no hillock of earth near this hole,
which makes it probable that the oblique entrance
is made hollow from the outside, and
that the perpendicular hole is worked within-side
from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The habitation of the female has also an
oblique passage, with two, three, and even
eight perpendicular holes, by which the young
ones may come in and go out. The male and
female have each a separate abode, and the female&rsquo;s
is deeper than that of the male.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both male and female burrow in the earth,
at one or two feet distance from the perpendicular
holes; and according to their age, and
in proportion as they multiply, they form one,
two, or three particular cavities, in form of
vaults, as well above as below, and which are
more or less spacious, according to the quantity
of their provisions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The perpendicular hole is the common
passage by which they go in and out, and by
the oblique one they throw out the earth which
they scratch up. This passage also has a
gentle declivity into some of the cavities, and
a more steep one in others, which serves for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
a free circulation of air in their subterraneous
habitations. The cavity where the female
brings forth her young contains no provision,
but is only a nest formed of straw and herbs.
The depth of the cavities is very different.
The young hamster in his first year makes
its burrow only a foot deep, while the old
animals often dig to the depth of four or five
feet: all the cavities communicate together in
one habitation, and which is sometimes from
eight to ten feet diameter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These animals store their magazines with
dry clover, corn in the ear, and beans and peas
in their pods; having separated they carry out
the husks and pods by the oblique passage.
They commonly begin to get in their winter
store about the end of August, and which they
convey to their habitations in a pouch they
have in their cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the hamster has filled his magazines
he covers them over, and carefully shuts
all the avenues to them with earth: this precaution
renders the discovery of these animals
very difficult, and the heaps of earth which
they throw up before the oblique passage are
the only marks to trace their habitations. The
most usual method of making them is by
digging them out of their holes, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
attended with much trouble, on account of the
depth and extent of their burrows. However,
a man versed in this business commonly effects
his purpose with good success and profit, for
in autumn he seldom fails of finding two
bushels of good corn in each habitation, and
the fur of these animals is valuable. The
hamsters bring forth two or three times in a
year, and seldom less than five or six. Some
years there are great numbers of them to be
seen, and in others scarcely any to be met with.
They multiply considerably when the seasons
are wet, which causes a great scarcity of grain
by the immense devastations they make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hamster begins to burrow at the age
of six weeks or two months; but they never
copulate in the first year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pole-cat is a great enemy to the hamsters,
which he destroys in great numbers, and
even takes possession of their holes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The back of the hamster is commonly
brown, and the belly white; there are some,
however, of a grey colour, and this difference
may proceed from their age; besides these,
others are met with entirely black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hamsters destroy each other like field-mice;
two of them being put into the same
cage, the female killed the male in the night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and having divided the muscles that held the
jaws together, she devoured great part of his
viscera. There are great numbers produced in
one year, and are so destructive that in some
parts of Germany a reward is fixed on their
heads. They are indeed so numerous there that
their fur is an important article of commerce.</p>

<p>All these circumstances, which we have extracted
from the Memoir of M. de Waitz, and
the observations of M. de Montmirail, appear
to be true, and agree with what we have learnt
from other quarters on this subject; but it is
not so certain, as mentioned in the same Memoir,
that these animals are dormant the whole
winter, and recover in spring. The hamster,
which we kept during the winter of 1762-3,
in a chamber without any fire, and where the
cold was intense enough to freeze water, did
not become torpid, but moved about, and ate
as usual; while the dormice which we had alive were
benumbed with a much less degree of cold.
Therefore the hamster has not any affinity
with the marmot or dormice in this respect;
and it is very improperly denominated the
<i>Strasburgh marmot</i> by some of our naturalists,
since it does not sleep like the marmot, and is
not to be found in the vicinity of Strasburgh.</p>

<p>In an extract from a German publication
of M. Sulzer, which appeared in the Gazette
de LittÃ©rature of the 13th of September, 1774,
we find many additional observations respecting
the hamster. As a proof of its multiplicity in
Germany an instance is given, that in one
year was taken to the town-house at Gotha,
11,574 skins, in another 54,429, and in a third
80,139. It is also there stated, that the male
is a courageous animal, and will defend himself
against the attacks of either dogs, cats, or
men; that he is naturally of a morose disposition,
agrees not with his own species, and
will even at times destroy his own family; he
devours mice, birds, or any animal that he can
overcome, and he drinks very little. In the
winter they retire into their holes, where the
female remains much longer than the males;
she goes four weeks with young, and generally
has six at a litter. When in a torpid
state they do not appear to respire, or to have
the smallest degree of feeling. On opening the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
chest, however, the heart is perceived to beat
at the rate of fifteen times in a minute, whereas,
when in full spirits, and somewhat irritated,
it has been known to beat 180 times in the
same space; when in this state, which he is
never reduced to in the open air, an electric
shock will not rouse him.</p>

<p>From the fact which we formerly stated,
namely, that the hamster which we kept confined
in a cage, and in a room where water was
frozen, was not reduced to a torpid state, we
cannot but regret that M. Sulzer has not stated
the degree of cold, or want of air, which rendered
them so. M. Allemand has confirmed
this fact in the observations he has added to
the hamster in the Dutch edition of my work.
Among other remarks, he says, this animal is
of the mouse kind, and sleeps during winter,
like the marmot; he is of a forbidding external
appearance, and his manners are not less
disgusting; for he has not a single social quality;
he destroys and devours every animal he
can conquer, not excepting his own species;
and even the females, to whom he is led by
instinct, would suffer no better fate, after the
gratification of his passions, which are of short
duration, if she did not contrive her escape, or
secure her own life by the killing of him first.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
These animals pass the winter in a torpid state,
and are the only ones of Europe which have
pouches in their cheeks. They avoid extremes,
and are not to be found either in very
warm or very cold countries. As he feeds
upon grain, and dwells under the earth, it is
necessary for the construction of his habitation
that the soil should neither be hard, sandy,
nor marshy, but one that is easily penetrated,
and yet so firm as not to crumble down; and
it is for this reason that the hamsters are more
numerous in Thuringia than in any other
place, where also they have the equally great
advantage of procuring all kinds of grain with
ease, it being an abundant article in that country.</p>

<p>The hamsters come in season about the end
of April, when the males seek out the females,
who always have separate habitations, but do
not remain with them above a few days. If
two males meet in the same hole they instantly
attack each other, and never give over until
one has laid the other dead at his feet. The
victor of course takes possession of the female,
and during their amours they lay aside that
ferocity with which at other times they
constantly persecute each other; nay, they
will at this time act for their mutual defence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and if their hole happens to be opened, and
the female perceives the male in danger, she
will fly at their disturber, and inflict deep and
painful wounds. The females bring forth two
or three times every year, they seldom have
less than six young, and more frequently from
sixteen to eighteen; they grow very fast, for
they begin to dig the earth when they are fifteen
days old, and are entirely thrown off by
their mother when they are three weeks old.
They have little attachment to their offspring,
for if their habitations are attacked the mother&rsquo;s
only solicitude is to take care of herself; for
which she penetrates deeper into the earth, and
is so regardless of the cries of her young that
she even blocks up the hole after her to prevent
their following.</p>

<p>They feed on all kinds of herbs, roots, grain,
and the flesh of those animals which they can
subdue. As they are not calculated for going
a great distance, they lay in their first store of
such provisions as the fields in their immediate
vicinity present, and this is the reason why one
of their chambers is often found full of a single
sort of grain; but as the harvest is got in they
go to greater distances, carrying back with
them every thing they can meet with, without
distinction; and for this purpose Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
has bestowed on them a pouch in each cheek,
the outsides of which are smooth and membranous,
and the insides furnished with a
number of glands, which supply a fluid, and
keep them so flexible that they receive no injury
from any kinds of grain they may wish
to convey, however rough or sharp. In each
of these pouches he can carry an ounce and a
half of grain, and which he empties by pressing
his fore-feet against his cheeks. When a hamster
is met thus loaded he may be taken with
the hand, because at that time he cannot bite;
but if he is not laid hold of instantly he soon
empties his pouches, and will defend himself.
An old male will collect a great quantity of
grain in this manner, and there have been
instances of finding 100 pounds weight in a
single hole; but the females and the young
ones do not store so much.</p>

<p>If their holes are opened in winter, the animal
is found lying upon a bed of soft straw,
with his head bent between his two fore-legs
under his belly, and his hind feet turned up
and resting on his nose; his eyes are quite
shut, and if forced open they close again immediately;
in a word, he has every appearance
of a dead animal, and his whole body
feels as cold as ice. This torpid state of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
hamster has been attributed to a certain degree
of cold; but although that may be the
case with bats and dormice, yet it is necessary
with this animal that he should also be deprived
of the impression of the air; for if he be shut
up in a cage, and put in a room where water
will freeze, he will not become torpid; but if
that cage is buried some feet under the earth,
and so covered that the air cannot penetrate to
him, he will in the course of a few days become
equally so as if he were in an habitation of his
own framing. The cage being brought up
the animal soon recovers in the air, and if put
under the earth he sinks again into his torpid
state; and this he will continue to do as long
as there is any frost. The same circumstance
takes place if they are dug out of their holes
during their torpor, after being a few hours exposed
to the air, they invariably awake, whether
it is night or day, which proves that light is
not part of the cause. In recovering from his
torpid state the limbs of the hamster first begin
to lose their stiffness, he then breathes, but at
long intervals; by degrees opens his mouth and
eyes; at length he endeavours to get upon his
legs, and continues his efforts until he has accomplished
that point; when after standing perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
still for a few moments, he begins to
walk and go about as usual.</p>

<p>This animal seems to be influenced by no
other passions but rage, for he invariably makes
war against all that come in his way, regardless
of their superiority in size or strength. He has
no idea of flight, and will suffer himself to be
beat to pieces rather than yield. When he
sees a dog coming towards him, he empties his
cheeks, if he happens to be loaded, then swells
them up to an enormous size, waits the approach
of his enemy, who being sufficiently
near, he rises upon his hind legs, and darts furiously
upon him; and if he once makes good
his hold he never quits it without the loss of life;
but the dogs, who are fond of hunting them,
generally avoid the first attack, and then seize
them by the back. His ferocious disposition is
not only exercised against other animals, but
even his own species, for two hamsters never
meet but they attack each other, and fight till
one is slain, whom the conqueror devours; and
in this respect there is no difference even if the
rencounter is between a male and female.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a></p>

<p>The name of the <i>Strasburgh marmot</i> has
been affixed to the hamster, and that of the
<i>Poland marmot</i> to the bobak (<a href="#FIG_171"><i>fig. 171.</i></a>). But
it is as certain, that the hamster is not a marmot,
as it is probable the bobak is one; for he
only differs from the marmot of the Alps by
the colour of his hair, which instead of being
brown is rather a pale yellow: he has also a
thumb, or claw, to the fore-feet, while the marmot
has only four toes and no thumb; but in
every other respect they perfectly resemble,
which makes us presume they do not form two
distinct species. It is the same with respect to
the monax, or Canadian marmot, which some
travellers have termed the <i>whistler</i>: he only
seems to differ from the marmot by the tail,
which is longer and thicker of hair. Therefore
the Canadian monax, the Poland bobak,
and the Alpine marmot, appear to be all the
same animal, which from the influence of different
climates have undergone those alterations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
we have before particularized. As this
species prefers the coldest and highest mountains,
and inhabits Poland, Russia, and other
parts of the north of Europe, no wonder it is
found in Canada, where it is only somewhat
less, a circumstance not particular to it alone;
for all animals common to both continents are
smaller in the new than in the old.</p>

<p>The Siberian animal, called by the Russians
<i>jevraschka</i>, is a kind of marmot, still less than
the Canadian monax, the head of which is
round, and the snout snubbed. It has no external
ears, nor can the auditory passages be
seen without turning back the hair. The
length of the body, including the head, is not
above a foot; the tail, which is scarcely three
inches long, is nearly round towards the body,
then flat, and truncated towards as extremity.
The body is thick, the hair yellow, mixed
with grey, and blackish towards the end of the
tail. The legs are short, but those before are
somewhat longer than those behind. The
hind feet have five toes, with five black claws,
a little crooked: the fore feet have but four.
When these animals are irritated, or when they
are surprised, they bite violently, and make a
shrill noise like the marmot. They sit upon
their hind legs to feed, and carry the food to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
their mouths with their fore paws. They copulate
in spring, and bring forth in summer;
commonly five or six at a time. They dig
burrows for their winter residence, and the females
suckle their young at the bottom of their
habitations. Though these animals bear a
great resemblance to the marmots, they nevertheless
seem to be a different species, for the
Poland or Alpine species of marmot are found
in the same parts of Siberia, which the inhabitants
call <i>suroks</i>, and these two species have
never been observed to mix together, nor produce
an intermediate race.</p>

<p>Jerboa is a generic name, which is made
use of to denote those remarkable animals whose
legs are extremely disproportionate; those before
being not above one inch long, and those
behind two inches one fourth, exactly resembling
those of a bird. There are four distinct
species, or varieties, in this genus; first, the
<i>tarsier</i>, which we have already spoken of, and
which is certainly a particular species, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
five toes on each foot, like those of a monkey.
Secondly, the <i>jerboa</i>, which has four toes on
the fore-feet, and three on those behind. Third,
the <i>alagtaga</i>, whose feet are formed like those
of the jerboa, with this difference, that it has
five toes on the fore-feet, and three on the
hind, with a spur, that may be considered as
a thumb, or fourth toe, much shorter than the
others. Fourth, the <i>daman Israel</i>, or <i>lamb of
Israel</i>, which has four toes to the fore feet, and
five on those behind, and which may possibly
be the same animal that LinnÃ¦us has described
under the name of <i>mus longipes</i>.</p>

<p>The head of the jerboa is sloped somewhat
in the manner of a rabbit; but the eyes are
larger, and the ears shorter, higher, and
broader in proportion to its size. Its nose is
deprived of hair, and is of a flesh colour, and
its muzzle short and thick, the orifice of the
mouth very narrow, the upper jaw very broad,
and the lower narrow and short; the teeth
are like those of a rabbit; the whiskers are
composed of long black and white hairs;
the fore feet are very short, and never touch
the ground; they are furnished with four
claws, and are only used as hands to carry
the food to the mouth; the hind feet have but
three toes, the middle one is longest, and all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
them have claws; the tail is three times longer
than the body, and is covered with short
stubborn hair, of the same colour as those on
the back, but tufted at the end with longer
and softer hair; the legs, nose, and ears, are
bare, and of a flesh colour; the upper part of
the head and back are covered with reddish
hair, the sides, throat, and belly, are whitish;
below the reins, and near the tail, there is a
large black, transversal band, in the form of a
crescent.</p>

<p>The alagtaga is smaller than a rabbit, its
body is shorter, its ears are long, wide, bare,
thin, transparent, and sprinkled with blood-vessels,
which are very apparent; the upper
jaw is much larger than the lower, but blunt
and pretty wide at the extremity; the whiskers
are large; the teeth are like those of the
rat, the eyes full, with the iris and pupil of
a brown colour. The body of this animal
is narrow before, but very broad and round
behind; the tail is very long, it is not so
thick as the little finger of a man, and about
two-thirds of it is covered with short and
rough hair, which grows longer, softer, and
thicker, towards the end, till at length it forms
a kind of tuft, black at the beginning, and
white towards the extremity.   The fore-feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
are very short and have five toes, the hind ones,
which are very long, have only four, three of
which are placed forwards, and the fourth,
which is a kind of thumb, stands at about an
inch distant from the rest. All these toes are
furnished with claws, shorter in the hind than
in the fore-feet. The hair of this animal is
soft, pretty long, yellow on the back, and
whitish under the belly.</p>

<p>By comparing these two descriptions, the
first of which is taken from Edwards and Hasselquist,
and the second from Gmelin, we shall
perceive, that these animals resemble each other
as much as possible. The jerboa is only smaller
than the alagtaga, and has only four toes on the
fore-feet, and three on the hind ones, without
any spur; while the other has five on the
fore-feet, and three and a spur on those behind;
but I am inclined to think this difference is not
universal, for Dr. Shaw, who has given a description
of the jerboa of Barbary, represents
it with this spur, or fourth toe, on the hind-feet;
and Mr. Edwards remarks, that he carefully
examined two jerboas he saw in England,
and that he saw no spur in either of them.
Thus this character which would specifically
distinguish the jerboa from the alagtaga, not
being universal is of no consequence, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
rather remarks the identity, than the diversity
of the species. Neither is the difference of
size any greater proof of their being two different
species; possibly Edwards and Hasselquist
have only described young jerboas, and
M. Gmelin, an old alagtaga. There are only
two things which create any doubt in my mind,
viz. the difference in the size of their tails, and
the variety in the climates they inhabit, for the
jerboa is common in Circassia, Egypt, Barbary,
and Arabia; and the alagtaga, in Tartary,
along the Wolga, and as far as Siberia. It is
seldom that the same kind of animal inhabits
such different climates; and whenever it does
happen the species undergoes great changes;
which, we presume, is the case with the jerboa,
of which the alagtaga, notwithstanding these
differences, seems to be only a variety.</p>

<p>These little animals commonly conceal their
hands, or fore-feet, among their hair; so that
at first they appear to have only hind-feet.
When they move from one place to another,
they do not walk, that is advance one foot
before the other, but jump or bound with the
greatest ease, four or five feet at a time; they
rest themselves in a kneeling posture, and only
sleep in the day. In the night they seek for
food, like hares, and like them, feed on grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and all kinds of grain. They are of a gentle
nature, but are not to be tamed beyond a certain
limit. They burrow like rabbits, and in
much less time. They lay up a store of grass
towards the end of summer in their habitations,
and in which, in cold countries, they remain
during the winter.</p>

<p>With respect to the daman, or lamb of
Israel, which seems to be of the jerboa kind,
as its fore-legs are much shorter than those
behind, having never seen it, we cannot do better
than copy the description of it as given by
Dr. Shaw, who speaks of these two animals as of
different kinds: &ldquo;The daman (says this author)
is also a native of Mount Lebanon, and
common to be met with in Syria and Phoenicia;
it is a very harmless animal, resembling the
common rabbit in size, shape, and also in the
disposition of the fore-teeth; but it is somewhat
browner, has smaller eyes, and a head
more pointed. Its fore-feet are short, and those
behind long, much in the same proportion as
those of the jerboa. Although it sometimes
conceals itself in the earth, its common retreat
is in the hollows and clefts of rocks, which is
a strong reason to conclude that it is this animal
and not the jerboa, which is meant in
Scripture by the <i>Saphan</i>. I have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
been able to learn from any one why it was
called the <i>daman</i> of Israel, which signifies the
<i>lamb</i> of Israel.&rdquo; Prosper Alpinus, who mentioned
this animal before Dr. Shaw, says, that
its flesh is delicate food, and that it is much
bigger than the European rabbit; but this last
circumstance seems doubtful, for Dr. Shaw has
omitted this passage of Prosper Alpinus, whom,
in other respects, he has fully quoted.</p>

<p>This animal in Egypt is called <i>mangutia</i>,
but we shall adopt the name <i>ichneumon</i> (<a href="#FIG_172"><i>fig. 172.</i></a>)
given it by Aristotle, and others. It is
as domestic in Egypt as the cat is in Europe;
and is alike serviceable to destroy rats and mice.
But its inclination for prey is much stronger and
more violent, for it hunts and eats with the same
avidity, birds, quadrupeds, serpents, lizards,
and insects. It attacks every living creature,
and feeds entirely on animal flesh; its courage
is equal to the sharpness of its appetite, being
neither intimidated by the anger of the dog, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the malice of the cat; it even dreads not the
bite of the serpent, but pursues, seizes, and
kills them, however venomous. As soon as
it begins to feel the effects of their venom, it
immediately goes in search of antidotes, and
particularly of a root which the Indians call by
its name, and which, they say, is a most sure
and powerful remedy against the bite of the
viper or asp. It sucks the eggs of the crocodile,
as well as those of fowls and birds; it also
kills and eats the young crocodiles, though
they are very strong even when scarcely come
out of the shell; and as fable commonly precedes
truth, it has been alleged that, in consequence
of this antipathy, the ichneumon
enters the body of the crocodile when he is
asleep, and never quits him till it has devoured
his entrails.</p>

<p>Naturalists have supposed that there are several
kinds of ichneumons, because there are
some larger, and of a different colour from
others; but if we consider, that being often
reared in houses, they must, like other domestic
animals, undergo changes, we shall readily
perceive that this diversity of colour and size
only indicates simple varieties, not sufficient
to constitute a separate species; especially as
in the two ichneumons which I have seen alive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
and in many stuffed skins I examined, I did not
observe that the intermediate shades both of
size and colour differed from the rest by any
evident and constant character; and it only
appears, that in Egypt, where the ichneumons
may be said to be domestic, they are larger
than those in India, where they are wild.</p>

<p>Nomenclators, who are never willing that a
being should be only what it is, have greatly
varied on the subject of the ichneumon. LinnÃ¦us
first made it of the badger kind, and directly
after of the ferret. Hasselquist, following
the lessons of his master, also makes it a
badger. Klein and Brisson have placed it in
the weasel class, others in the otter, and some
with the rat.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> I only quote these ideas to shew
the want of consistency, and the contradictions,
which are to be met with in what are called
generic denominations, and which are generally
false, arbitrary, vague, and equivocal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_AS_45" id="Footnote_AS_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AS_45"><span class="label">[AS]</span></a> Professor Cuvier classes it with the bear.</p></div>

<p>The ichneumon is fond of living by the
sides of rivers. During the inundations it
quits its habitation, and even seeks for prey
near inhabited places. They walk without
making any noise, and change their manner
as occasion requires. Sometimes they carry
their heads erect, foreshorten their bodies, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
rise upon their hind-legs; at other times they
creep and lengthen their bodies like a serpent.
It often sits upon its hind-legs, and more often
darts like an arrow upon its prey; its eyes are
lively and full of fire; its physiognomy is
beautiful, its body very agile, legs short, tail
thick and very long, and its hair rough, and
sometimes curled. Both male and female have
a remarkable orifice, independent of the natural
passages; a kind of pouch, in which an
odoriferous liquor is secreted; and some have
asserted that the ichneumon opens this pouch
to refresh itself when too hot. Its nose is very
sharp, and its mouth narrow, which prevents
it from seizing any thing very large; but these
wants are amply supplied by agility and courage.
It very easily strangles a cat, though
bigger and stronger than itself; it often fights
with dogs, and however large commonly gets
the better of them.</p>

<p>Their growth is very quick, and their lives
but of short duration: they are very common
throughout all the southern parts of Asia, from
Egypt to Java; and are even to be met with
in Africa, as far as the Cape of Good Hope;
but they will not live and produce in our temperate
climates; they are distressed by wind,
and the frost destroys them; to avoid the one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and to counteract the effects of the other by
warmth, they roll themselves up with their
heads under their bellies. The ichneumon was
much esteemed by the ancient Egyptians, and
is still protected with much care upon account
of the essential service it performs in the destruction
of noxious animals, particularly the
crocodiles, whose eggs it knows how to discover
even in the sand, and which creatures
would become very formidable, from their
great multiplication, one female laying near
five hundred eggs, if it were not that the ichneumons
destroy them.</p>

<p>This animal is called by some travellers
the <i>genet of Madagascar</i>, because it resembles
the genet in colour, and some other affinities;
but it is in general much smaller, and has not
the odoriferous bag, which is an essential character
belonging to that animal. As we were
not certain as to this fact, not being able to
procure one for dissection, we wrote to M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
de Poivre, who had sent us the skin of a fossane
stuffed, and who favoured us with the following
answer:&mdash;Lyons, July 19, 1761. &ldquo;The
fossane which I brought from Madagascar is
an animal whose manners are much like those
of our marten. The inhabitants of the island
assured me, that when the male is in heat it
emits a very strong smell like musk. When
I stuffed the skin which is in the royal gardens
I did not discover any bag, nor did I find any
odoriferous smell. I reared two similar animals,
the one at Cochinchina, and another in
the Phillippine Islands; they were both males;
I had them very young, and kept them about,
two or three months, in which time they had
become pretty familiar. I never found any
bag in the parts you speak of, but only observed
that their excrements had the same
smell as those of our marten. They eat flesh
and fruits, but preferred the latter, and were
exceedingly partial to bananas, which they
devoured with voracity. This is a very wild
animal, and difficult to tame; though taken
when very young, yet it preserved the look and
character of ferocity, which appeared to me
somewhat extraordinary in an animal who
feeds by preference on fruits. The eye of the
fossane represents a large black globe, in comparison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
with the size of its head, which gives
it a mischievous aspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It gives us great pleasure to have here an
opportunity of testifying our thanks to M. de
Poivre, who from a real taste for natural history,
and a friendship for those who cultivate
it, has presented to the cabinet a great number
of scarce and curious animals.</p>

<p>The animal called <i>berbÃ©</i>, in Guinea seems
to us to be the same as the fossane, and consequently
that this species exists in Africa as
well as in Asia. &ldquo;The <i>berbÃ©</i> (says Bosman) has a
more pointed snout, and a smaller body,
than our cat, and is speckled like the civet.&rdquo;
We know of no animal with which these characters
so well agree as with that of the fossane.</p>

<p>Those who have spoken of this animal
have taken it for a ferret, to which indeed it
has a great resemblance; but it differs in
characters sufficiently strong to warrant our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
considering it as a distinct species. The vansire,
or, as it is called by some, the Madagascar
weasel, of which place it is a native, has
twelve grinders in its upper jaw, while the ferret
has only eight; and the lower grinders,
though ten in number in both animals, are
neither alike in shape nor situation. Besides,
the vansire differs in the colour of its hair from
all ferrets, though those, like every other animal
which man is careful of rearing and increasing,
vary so much in colour, that there is
a difference even between male and female.</p>

<p>To us it appears, that the animal mentioned
by Seba as the <i>weasel of Java</i>, and which, he
says, the natives call <i>koger-angan</i>, and afterwards
spoken of by Brisson by the name of the
<i>ferret of Java</i>, may possibly be the same animal
as the vansire, at least it comes nearer to
the vansire than to any animal at present
known; but Seba&rsquo;s description is not sufficiently
complete to establish a just comparison,
which is absolutely necessary to form a
solid and explicit judgment.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_AT_46" id="Footnote_AT_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AT_46"><span class="label">[AT]</span></a> The word <i>maki</i> has probably been derived from <i>mocoek</i>
or <i>maucauc</i>, which is the name given to these animals at Mozambique
and in the islands of Madagascar, whence it originally
proceeded.</p></div>


<p>As this name Maki has been given to several
animals we can only use it as a generic term,
under which we comprehend three animals of
the same class, but varying in characters sufficiently
numerous to constitute different species.
These three animals have long tails, and feet
shaped like those of the monkey; but their
snout is long, like that of the martin; and they
have six incisive teeth in the under jaw, while
the monkeys have but four.</p>

<p>The first of this kind is the mococo, or
maucauco, (<a href="#FIG_173"><i>fig. 173.</i></a>) commonly known by
the name of the <i>ring-tailed maki</i>. The second
is the mongous, (<a href="#FIG_174"><i>fig. 174.</i></a>) commonly called
the <i>brown maki</i>; but this denomination is misapplied,
for there are among this kind, various
colours, some are all brown, others with white
cheeks and feet, and still others whose cheeks
are black and feet are yellow. The third is
the <i>vari</i>, (<a href="#FIG_175"><i>fig. 175.</i></a>) called by some the <i>pied
maki</i>: but this denomination has been also
misapplied, for besides those which are pied,
that is black and white, there are some all
white, and others entirely black. These animals
are all natives of the eastern parts of
Africa, and principally of Madagascar, where
they are found in great numbers.</p>

<p>The maucauco is a beautiful animal; he is
remarkable for the largeness of his eyes, and
the length of the hind legs, which by far exceed
those before, and for his long and handsome
tail which is continually elevated, and in
motion, and upon which are thirty rings alternately
black and white, all very distinct and
separate from each other. He is of a gentle
disposition, and although he greatly resembles
the monkeys in many particulars, he has not
any of their malicious dispositions. When in
a state of liberty, they are frequently seen at
Madagascar in companies of thirty or forty
together. This animal is neither mischievous
nor ferocious; but as he is always in motion,
it is customary to keep him chained when in a
state of captivity, for he may be rendered so
tame as to be let loose without any danger of
his quitting his master. When he moves, it is
in an oblique direction, like all animals which
have hands instead of feet. He jumps with
greater facility than he walks, and is so silent
an animal, that his voice is seldom heard, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
when irritated, and then he utters a sharp,
but very short cry. He sleeps in a sitting posture,
with his muzzle resting on his breast. His
body is not thicker than that of a cat, but it is
longer, and he appears to be larger than he really
is from the length of his legs. His hair is very
soft, although it stands almost upright. The
genital parts of the male maucauco are small
and concealed, while those of the mongous are
disproportionally large and apparent.</p>

<p>The mongous is less than the maucauco,
but his hair is likewise short, silky, and a little
curled. His nose is thicker, and resembles
that of the vari. I had a mongous in my possession
for several years; his coat was brown,
his eyes yellow, his nose black, and his ears
short. He had a custom of playing with, and
biting his own tail, and by this method destroyed
four or five of the last vertebrÃ¦. He was
very slovenly, and so troublesome that we were
obliged to keep him chained. Whenever he
got loose, he visited the shops in the neighbourhood,
and would make free with fruit, sugar,
sweetmeats, &amp;c. and to obtain which, he would
open the boxes that contained them. At such
times it was difficult to retake him, and he
would bite even those he best knew. He was
almost continually grumbling, and when weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of being alone, he made a loud noise which
somewhat resembled the croaking of a frog.
This was a male animal, and had extremely
large testicles for the size of his body. He was
fond of she-cats, but his connection with them
was too slight to be productive. He was very
fearful of the cold and wet, and never stirred
far from the fire-side, where he sat upright to
warm himself. He was fed with bread and
fruits; his tongue was rough, like that of a
cat, and he would lick a person&rsquo;s hand until it
became inflamed, and if not guarded against
would generally end with a bite. He died with
the cold in the winter, 1750, although he never
stirred from the fire-side. He was very
brisk in his motions, and sometimes petulant.
He often slept in the day, or rather dozed, for
his sleep was so light, that he was disturbed
with the least noise.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of the mongous
both in colour and size. The one we have
just mentioned was quite brown, and about
the size of a middling cat. We saw one
which, though adult, was not bigger than the
loir. If this small mongous had not perfectly
resembled the great one in every respect but in
size, it would certainly have been a different
species; but the resemblance was so perfect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
that we think ourselves justifiable in ranking
them together.</p>

<p>The <i>vari</i> is much longer, stronger, and
wilder, than the maucauco, and is even dangerous
in its free state. Travellers tell us,
&ldquo;that these animals are as furious as tigers,
and very difficult to be tamed; and that their
voice is so very loud, that when there are only
two together in the woods, it might be imagined
the noise proceeded from a hundred.&rdquo;
The voice of the vari is somewhat like the
roaring of the lion, and is very alarming to
those who hear it for the first time. This
astonishing power of voice in an animal of so
middling a size, depends on the singular structure
of the windpipe, the two branches of
which enlarge and form a concavity near its
entrance into the tubes of the lungs. Thus he
differs greatly from the maucauco both by nature
and conformation. His hair in general is
much longer, and he has a kind of ruff round
the neck, consisting of very long hair, which
forms a very apparent character, and by which
he may easily be distinguished. In colour he
varies from quite black to white, and his hair,
though very long and soft, stands very nearly
upright. His muzzle is thicker and longer
than that of the maucauco. His ears are much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
shorter, and edged with long hairs; and his
eyes are of so deep an orange-colour, that they
appear to be red.</p>

<p>The maucauco, the mongous, and the vari,
are all of the same country; and seem to be
confined to Madagascar, Mozambique, and the
neighbouring lands of those islands. It does
not appear, by the testimony of any traveller,
that they are to be found in any other part of
the world; and seem to be in the Old Continent,
what the opossums are in the New. In
respect to shape, the makis seem to fill up the
shade between the long-tailed monkey, and
lower orders of quadrupeds; for they have four
hands and a long tail like monkeys, and at the
same time, have a long muzzle like foxes and
polecats. In their manners, the makis, however,
partake more of the monkey, for although
they sometimes feed upon flesh, and
take pains to seize on birds, they are less carnivorous
than frugivorous; and even in a domestic
state they prefer roots, fruit, and bread,
to flesh, raw or roasted.</p>

<p>All obvious typographical errors were corrected. Where several
variant spellings were used, the most prevalent version was use to
standardize them. All illustration headers were standardized to display
&ldquo;<i>Engraved for Barr&rsquo;s Buffon.</i>&rdquo; above each group and the captions were
also standardized. Illustrations which split paragraphs were moved
to rejoin them and in some cases, moved to the end of the section.
The Illustrations of the Camel and the Dromedary were moved below the
book title.To match the other volumes in this series, the list for
the placement of images was positioned after the Table of Contents.
